    <br/><br/>
    To keep my demo reel up to date without having to constantly re-edit it, I've built this javascript video player specifically to play back randomized video clips from a selected folder. The script is still experimental, and I still have to write the buffering portion of the code, so the only browser that I know can handle all of the videos being loaded at once is chrome. I promise to write the last bit of the code in the next few days.
