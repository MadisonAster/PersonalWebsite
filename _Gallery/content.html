            The latest data, released today, shows a zoomed-in view of a vast, smooth plain north of the mountains in an area unofficially dubbed “Tombaugh Regio” in honor of the man who discovered Pluto—Clyde Tombaugh. Moore went on to say, “This terrain is not easy to explain; however, the discovery of vast crater-less, very young plains on Pluto exceeds all pre-fly expectations.” The icy plains of Pluto seen in the image—unofficially named Sputnik Planum after the first satellite launched in space—resemble frozen mud cracks like we see here on Earth. This could be evidence for contraction of surface materials, like when mud dries and cracks, or even signs of convection below the surface. More data will be needed to tell.

            The region is broken into irregular “polygons,” approximately 20 kilometers across; these are bordered by shallow troughs. Some of the troughs are filled with a dark surface material, while some harbor groups of hills. The hills could have been pushed up via interior processes, or they could be erosion-resistant features.

            Mountains can be formed in many ways, and the team cannot definitively say how these came to be. But they can rule out tidal heating. There are no other large bodies near Pluto other than its largest moon, Charon, and since it is tidally locked with Charon, there is not a large heat exchange system between the two bodies. There must therefore be some other geologic process taking place.

            Whatever provides the power, it could reshape the surface through possibilities that include geysers and or cryovolcanoes. Neither of these processes has been observed yet, but the team will be looking for evidence of them.
