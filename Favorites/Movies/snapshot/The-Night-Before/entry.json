They all look like masterpieces when compared to The Night Before. \n\nThere is no real plot here, just three guys trying to enjoy a night out (Christmas Eve) on the town. I like Seth Rogen but he is awful here. There are several gross out scenes for cheap laughs (I may have laughed twice in the whole movie), and a supporting cast that is completely wasted. Lizzy Caplan who is so fabulous in Masters of Sex is completely misused here (must have needed a new patio).\n\nI assumed that with a Metecritic score of 58 and the Washington Post reviewer giving it 2.5 stars the movie wouldn't be horrible, and even if it had no redeeming value it would be good for a number of laughs. I was so wrong.\n\nI'm temped to go see the other new Christmas movie, Love the Coopers, which has a Metacritic score of 29. Could it really be worse than this movie?\n\nDon't waste your time on this movie (time you'll never get back). Go see Brooklyn (good) or Spotlight (very good) or The Intern (excellent). They are all time well spent."}, "duration": "PT1H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi933671449", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjM0NzQzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTczNzQxNzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjM0NzQzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTczNzQxNzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In New York City for their annual tradition of Christmas Eve debauchery, three lifelong best friends set out to find the Holy Grail of Christmas parties since their yearly reunion might be coming to an end.", "uploadDate": "2015-10-29T08:57:21Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3530002", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Night-Before", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Night-Before/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Night-Before/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Night-Before/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Night-Before/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2016-02-22"}
