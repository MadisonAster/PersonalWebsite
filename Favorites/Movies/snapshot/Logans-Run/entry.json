To maintain the population balance, the computers that run the city have decreed that all people have to die at 30. This system is enforced by \"sandmen\" (Michael York , Richard Jordan) : black-clad cop operatives who terminate hunting \"runners\" ,those who try to live beyond 30. Logan, a sandman, whose job is to hunt fugitives , is sent on an assignment to find \"sanctuary,\" which is a code- word used by the master computer to describe what it thinks is a place to which runners have been getting away. Then Logan nearing the limit searches desperately for a way to avoid mandatory extermination . As a day outside the bubble Logan along with Jessica (Jenny Agutter) discover new emotions .\n\nThis classic Sci-fi contains suspense , thrills , action , breathtaking production design and is pretty entertaining though with some feeble stereotypes . Impressive big-budgeted production by Saul David enhanced immeasurably by an enjoyable cast as Michael York , Jenny Agutter , Farrah Fawcett and special mention to great Peter Ustinov . Roscoe Lee Browne both voiced and performed Box the robot on-set. The unwieldy costume made it impossible for Browne to right himself if he fell over. Colorful and spectacular cinematography in Todd-Ao 35 by Ernest Laszlo . Rousing and evocative musical score by the maestro Jerry Goldsmith . Jerry uses a full orchestra with no electronic instruments when the action is outside of the city. When inside the city, his orchestra consists solely of strings, piano, and electronic instruments , the music at the beginning of the film during the credits does add the electronic instruments with the full orchestra though. Dated but effective miniatures about a domed city near Washington, D.C. It earned a special Academy Award for visual effects by Glen Robinson . The motion picture is originally directed by Michael Anderson . Rating : PG (Parents guide) for some nudism and violence. Good but overlong and some corny moments, worthwhile watching . Followed by a brief TV series with Gregory Harrison , Heather Menzies and Donald Moffat", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Logan's Run", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2257239833", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDBhOTIzNTUtOWZhMy00OWY3LTkwYjktOGM4MTAyYzZlYTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDBhOTIzNTUtOWZhMy00OWY3LTkwYjktOGM4MTAyYzZlYTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2019-10-06T17:07:12Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074812", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Logans-Run", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Logans-Run/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Logans-Run/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Logans-Run/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Logans-Run/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
