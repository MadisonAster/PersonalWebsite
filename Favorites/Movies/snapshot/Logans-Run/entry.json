A grim look at the downside of maintaining an \"ideal\", utopian society.  When you hit 30, you either have the option of willingly submitting yourself to be killed under a pretense of renewal, or having the Sandmen play with you before they go in for the kill.  Neither option seems really appealing.  But the idea of one of the killers having to face their mortality is an interesting idea.\n\nA little slow in places (but I did keep wanting to see what would happen next), and some of the special effects look really dated (even to '77's \"Star Wars\"), but the story holds up well, and it's an entertaining ride overall.\n\nIt's truly a classic of the genre, and I wish I had seen it sooner.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Logan's Run", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2257239833", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDBhOTIzNTUtOWZhMy00OWY3LTkwYjktOGM4MTAyYzZlYTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDBhOTIzNTUtOWZhMy00OWY3LTkwYjktOGM4MTAyYzZlYTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2019-10-06T17:07:12Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074812", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Logans-Run", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Logans-Run/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Logans-Run/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Logans-Run/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
