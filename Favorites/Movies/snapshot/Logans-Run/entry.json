And yet somehow it all works.  I love this movie! Maybe it's the campy cornball that gets me every time.  I dunno.  Yet by the end I feel uplifted and even touched.  What a great scene with the timid girl touching Ustinov's beard at the end with Logan and Jessica in each other's arms looking on.\n\nWhile the acting is average (or perhaps its the lousy script) there are exceptions, thankfully mostly among the main cast.  Richard Jordan is just great as the relentless and unremorseful sandman.  And Ustinov is a lot of fun as the kooky old man.  Michael York, who've I've always liked, is servicable as our hero (thankfully they don't ask him to stretch his acting skills too much here). But without a doubt the real jewel is Jenny Agutter as Jessica-6.  I can't recall a part more perfectly cast.  Ms. Agutter is the epitome of beauty, youth and doe-eyed innocence.  And her underlying sensuality is impossible to miss in every scene she is in.  And as if that weren't enough she can act to boot!\n\nOf course there's a lot that I don't like about the movie, it's quite easy to pick apart.  But again, I don't know how, \"Logan's Run\" is much better than the sum of its parts.\n\nI hope they get the rumored remake off the ground, there's some good underlying sci-fi to be explored here and with a tightened up script, upgraded effects, better direction and editing you could have *real* winner. I just don't think they'll ever match the original casting job for Jessica-6.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Logan's Run", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2257239833", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDBhOTIzNTUtOWZhMy00OWY3LTkwYjktOGM4MTAyYzZlYTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDBhOTIzNTUtOWZhMy00OWY3LTkwYjktOGM4MTAyYzZlYTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2019-10-06T17:07:12Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074812", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Logans-Run", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Logans-Run/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Logans-Run/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Logans-Run/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Logans-Run/thumb.jpg"}
