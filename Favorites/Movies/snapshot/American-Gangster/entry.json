Yet it seems like they are all saying the same thing, that Gangster didn't have enough action and was really drawn out. Anyone who has every seen a Ridley Scott film will know that his films are long! Blade Runner, A Good Year, Matchstick Men, Hannibal, Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, G.I. Jane, Thelma and Louis, and Alien all ran for at least two hours or more, so big surprise there guys. In addition Scott didn't set out to film another scarface, he set out to tell a story not just about Frank Lucas but rather a tale of corruption and how pervasive it is. One user commented that this film had many side story lines that \"bloated\" the story. This is completely untrue as every \"side story\" is actually the overarching story about the fight against corruption in every facet of life, even Frank Lucas attempts several times to eradicate the corruption in his organization.\n\nOver all this is a great film which really gets into every nook and cranny of an issue. Don't see this film if your just looking for cheap thrills, this is a thinking film about the pervasive dishonesty of our culture.\n\nI gave this film 8 stars because i could find nothing solid that detracted from it, but rather a slew of minor details which gradually brought its score down. But I will put this film in my top films for the year, if only because I have been immensely unsatisfied with the bulk of releases this year.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "American Gangster", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3216048409", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3OTg2NzE1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU3MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3OTg2NzE1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU3MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "American Gangster Trailer", "uploadDate": "2007-08-30T08:16:46Z"}, "Title": "American Gangster", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765429", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/American-Gangster", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/American-Gangster/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/American-Gangster/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/American-Gangster/entry.json"}
