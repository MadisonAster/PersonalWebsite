The fact that such a character really did exist yet I do not remember it certainly intrigues me. I guess I was just too young at the time it broke. Now approaching my later forties finds me longing to research it further after seeing this movie.\n\nI get the feeling Ridley Scott was amazed a person such as Frank Lucas was actually able to do what he did and live to tell about it. I certainly share that amazement. The care in which he tells the story serves it well. Though it's basically a gangster movie it's not particularly graphic in violence except in a few scenes. Even Denzel's and Russel's portrayals of the two central characters are not quite as dark as the usual more stereotypical gangster/cop persona...Still there is a sense of doom and danger ever present as the viewer knows neither law enforcement, government, or mafia will let this man's drug empire go on.\n\nTo sum it up I believe this is an excellent telling of a true crime story. It's intriguing, entertaining, and certainly serves as a cautionary reminder to remain vigilant in combating drugs.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "American Gangster", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3216048409", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3OTg2NzE1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU3MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM3OTg2NzE1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU3MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "American Gangster Trailer", "uploadDate": "2007-08-30T08:16:46Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765429", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/American-Gangster", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/American-Gangster/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/American-Gangster/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/American-Gangster/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/American-Gangster/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
