The second part has a strong resemblance to Waking Life in it's psychedelic execution more than Waltz with Bashir. Existentialism, morality, Corporatocracy and the beautiful animation make this the most marvellous yet terrifying Sci-fi I have seen in ages. Watch Harvey Keitels monologue in the first half, it is outstanding. Robin Wright is as always amazing and gets extra kudos for playing herself in an alternate universe where her career has failed. It is all together a masterpiece.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H2M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi892512537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk1ODkwNzMwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU3NDAwMDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk1ODkwNzMwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU3NDAwMDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An aging, out-of-work actress accepts one last job, though the consequences of her decision affect her in ways she didn't consider", "uploadDate": "2013-08-06T19:57:14Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1821641", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Congress", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Congress/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Congress/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Congress/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-08-21"}
