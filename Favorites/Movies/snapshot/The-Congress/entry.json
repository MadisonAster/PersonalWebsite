I'd give it a 7,5 at least. I didn't know what to expect at all and was in for a surprisingly odd visual treat that looks mostly like an animated dream.\n\nI'm not sure I want to re-watch this film again (I might get a headache), it was quite something to ingest. There's also a lot there to think about and not everything makes sense. Nor did it have to as the film chose to display a dream world mostly.\n\nThe transitions between animated and live action are horrible, non-existent even. Also, the motivations (why does Robin escape to the dream world in a fancy car) are not always clear, neither is it always clear what's going on.\n\nJuggling with too many ideas, it's not consistently sticking to a core concept. I feel like I watched 2 movies. One like S1mone, but more serious. The other, more like an animated Being John Malkovich, less quirky but more poetic and equally self- referential (there's references to Robin Wright's actual acting career, she plays herself...).\n\nI could live with all it's flaws, because it was quite an intriguing film. I still give it a high score because it's concepts interested me and I think you have to see it also as a work of art to behold, not necessarily to comprehend. It's so different from the usual film, even if you watch (partially) animated films. The animation is the highlight of the film.\n\nI watched Planete Sauvage (trippy 1973 animation) a week ago and found this one equally stimulating for my brain as it feels expanded. Hadn't seen something like this since Paprika and this had more substance to boot even though it didn't focus and flesh it's ideas out enough. It was a bold attempt nonetheless.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H2M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi892512537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk1ODkwNzMwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU3NDAwMDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk1ODkwNzMwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU3NDAwMDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An aging, out-of-work actress accepts one last job, though the consequences of her decision affect her in ways she didn't consider", "uploadDate": "2013-08-06T19:57:14Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1821641", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Congress", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Congress/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Congress/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Congress/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Congress/thumb.jpg"}
