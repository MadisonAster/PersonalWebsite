What was wrong wasn't that these people were living according conservative values, but that they didn't really choose those values in the first place!\n\nI like the fact that the film was bold, and that it made its point as directly as it contrasted the black and white with the splotches of Technicolour.  While \"Pleasantville\" had little subtlety in its allegory, it was, like any good fairytale, beautiful in its simplicity.\n\nNine out of ten =)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Pleasantville", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2979791129", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTc1ZDU2OWUtMGFmYy00YmFhLWIyOGQtOWJiNzUyYzhlMzU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTc1ZDU2OWUtMGFmYy00YmFhLWIyOGQtOWJiNzUyYzhlMzU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:25:12Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120789", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pleasantville", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pleasantville/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pleasantville/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pleasantville/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pleasantville/thumb.jpg"}
