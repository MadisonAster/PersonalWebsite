If one views it as a \"Kill Bill\" kind of silliness that looks at the Mexican/Us border, then one may enjoy it. \n\nThe movie is not self-indulgent, rather it takes common stereotypes and puts them into funny situations. It has dark humor at times and makes no apologies for making fun of everything. It takes on many issues in a light-hearted way, but for some reason, it is not listed as a comedy. It, however, is a comedy. \n\nThe hero is a clever native American which is it's twist. The movie's plot is not predictable and it is filled with guns and shoot ups. It is a modern comedy that pokes fun at US politics and all its insincerity.\n\nWatch it. Do not take it seriously as an action flick and allow it to be the comedy that it is."}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Lady Gaga \"Aura\" Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi496085017", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExODE0MTUzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxNTczMDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExODE0MTUzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxNTczMDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The U.S. government recruits Machete to battle his way through Mexico in order to take down an arms dealer who looks to launch a weapon into space.", "uploadDate": "2013-10-05T07:44:30Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2002718", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Machete-Kills", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Machete-Kills/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Machete-Kills/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Machete-Kills/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Machete-Kills/thumb.jpg"}
