For many, this move towards a crazier style with even more unbelievable splatstick violence will be a step too far, the live-action-cartoon style antics exceeding many people's willingness to suspend disbelief. However, those who can find their way safely past this potential stumbling block should have a whale of a time.\n\nRodriguez directs proceedings with a carefree attitude and sense of fun that I found infectious, with all ideas\u2014no matter how dumb they must have looked on paper\u2014making their way into the final film. Thus, we have a Bond-style baddie in the form of megalomaniac Luther Voz (Mel Gibson), our hero killing numerous henchmen in a variety of creative ways, some innovative sci-fi weaponry, plenty of cool in-jokes for us movie geeks (I loved the visual reference to Mad Max II) and a bevy of lovely latino babes in sexy gear (including Alexa Vega in PVC and Michelle Rodriguez in tight, cleavage enhancing top). Hell, Rodriguez is having so much fun that he doesn't even care about the quality of his CGI, which only adds to the gleefully gaudy vibe.\n\nIt all gets very silly, and with the next sequel featuring Machete in space, it's set to get a whole lot sillier; I for one will make sure I've booked my seat for the ride.\n\n7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for being marginally more fun than the first one.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Lady Gaga \"Aura\" Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi496085017", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExODE0MTUzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxNTczMDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExODE0MTUzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxNTczMDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The U.S. government recruits Machete to battle his way through Mexico in order to take down an arms dealer who looks to launch a weapon into space.", "uploadDate": "2013-10-05T07:44:30Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2002718", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Machete-Kills", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Machete-Kills/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Machete-Kills/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Machete-Kills/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Machete-Kills/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-11-13"}
