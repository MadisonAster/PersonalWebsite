I didn't know what to expect when I came into it.  I had heard the buzz of the acting and the story, etc...but we've all heard that before and had been disappointed, but not so with this one.\n\nKevin Spacey plays this part to a \"T\".  He is strong when it requires and meek when it is needed.  His emotional rollercoaster ride is a trip to partake in. Annette Bening is marvelous as well.  I think they both should be nominated.\n\nThe support cast is also spectacular.  Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, and Mena Suvari all give great performances as the troubled \"Teenagers\" in the film. Of particular mention is Wes Bentley's performance, worthy of a supporting nomination as well.\n\nThis is a dramatic and funny tale of a man and his life in a state of turmoil and transition.  When he happens to see a beautiful friend of his daughter's at a cheerleading exhibition, he is completely infatuated with her beauty.  Using this as his inspiration, he attempts to change all aspects of his life.  He confronts his marriage, his job, his ego, and his libido.\n\nThe music in this film is also very well chosen.  There are moments when the music fits so perfectly with the scene that they meld together as one to present a perfect emotion.\n\nThe plot can get rather involved, but you will follow it endlessly to see where you go.  I was simply involved, hook, line and sinker.\n\nSee this movie more than once, and skip some of the other movies out now that are dare I say, trash.\n\nThis should be on the top of many critic's lists this year and it is certainly on top of mine.\n\nMy Rating (1 - 10):  10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H2M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi788506137", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NDcyNTgzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMwNzU0NzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU5NDcyNTgzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTMwNzU0NzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Lester Burnham, a depressed suburban father in a mid-life crisis, decides to turn his hectic life around after developing an infatuation for his daughter's attractive friend.", "uploadDate": "2013-04-03T14:22:07Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/American-Beauty", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/American-Beauty/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/American-Beauty/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/American-Beauty/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/American-Beauty/thumb.jpg"}
