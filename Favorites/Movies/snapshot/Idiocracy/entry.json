What I though would be a fun romp turned out to be about as scary as 1984. Who knew?\n\nThe plot is very silly, cartoony if you will, and Futurama, I'm looking at you. So yeah, there's an experiment that goes Horribly Wrong and our heroes wakes up in the far future. \n\nNow take a look at society today: reality TV, Donald Trump running for president, ketchup is a vegetable, the \"look at me\" culture. And turn in up to 11. That's this movie for you - a f-ing scary dystopia which I would have laughed my ass off from in the early 90's but today, it's just scary. \n\nBut it's still a fun and silly movie, it gives me tons of laughs.
