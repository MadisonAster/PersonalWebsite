The kind of movie where the good guys are people that in the real world, you wouldn't want living next to you, or even sitting next to you on a bus or plane. Even with the great Johnny Depp, and a $5.50 seniors' rate ticket , this movie was almost a total yawn. It was so bad,that the ushers requested that we leave our cell phones on.Or at least I wish."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Paul Kemp is a freelance journalist who finds himself at a critical turning point in his life while writing for a run-down newspaper in the Caribbean", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2617613337", "name": "Trailer #1", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5Njc0MTcyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzkyMjU0Ng@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5Njc0MTcyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzkyMjU0Ng@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2011-08-27T09:09:41Z"}, "url": "/title/tt0376136/"}
