Depp's role, unsurprisingly, mimics his portrayal of Hunter in Fear and Loathing (only with less drugs, not counting alcohol).\n\nThe movie can, realistically, be summed up in one \"revelation\" Depp's character has with a rather unusual counterpart. Throughout the film we see examples of the opulent lifestyle of few and downtrodden livings of the many. \n\nWhat Depp confides with his \"friend\", allows us to use what we have learned up to that point in the movie and chew on for the remainder of the movie, is this - the banks hold the wealth while leaving us (and the starving children) to stare at empty brass plates hanging on their front doors. Whether you agree with it or not, this is not a stretch to compare with the \"occupy\" movement settling into America and around Europe today.\n\nThis movie is good. Much like the original book, this movie doesn't try to entertain the viewer; it allows the viewer to sit back and follow along as one man experiences a lifetime of ups and downs in a matter of weeks. And be prepared to go out for a drink afterward, you'll need it."}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2617613337", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5Njc0MTcyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzkyMjU0Ng@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5Njc0MTcyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzkyMjU0Ng@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Paul Kemp is a freelance journalist who finds himself at a critical turning point in his life while writing for a run-down newspaper in the Caribbean", "uploadDate": "2011-08-27T09:09:41Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376136", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Rum-Diary", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Rum-Diary/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Rum-Diary/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Rum-Diary/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Rum-Diary/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-05-31"}
