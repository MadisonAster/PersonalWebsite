South Koreans have a dark past behind them, and they are terribly good at making movies that leaves traces. National Security is one of those movies.\n\nMost of the action takes place in a room where an innocent man is being tortured. The year is 1984, South Korea is a military regime and the man being tortured is accused of being a communist who tries starting a riot in South Korea. He denies it, and then starts the torture.\n\nWater Torture is never the same again after you've seen what they do to the innocent man in National Security. You get really tired after 1 hour, but the film runs on only more torture. You have got to not leave traces, so for the torture they used are water and electricity. It feels very realistic, where we see a naked man getting a proper water belly.\n\nAs with so many other splendid South Korean movies are there, National Security is an important film that thankfully shows progress for the country that will always have a dark shadow hanging over it. This is probably a great film, it is almost not wrong to call National Security a great film, but it is a quality film that is shocking, frightening, very well played and well made. The creeps well below the skin and you will not forget the movie soon.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2466786", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/National-Security", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/National-Security/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/National-Security/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/National-Security/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-06-17"}
