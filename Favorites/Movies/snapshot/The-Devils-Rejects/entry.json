This was better than Rob's \"House of 1000 Corpes\". It was sleazy, gruesome, and actually funny at times. Otis, Baby, and Captain Spaulding really do make this movie. The crazy thing is that I was actually rooting for them in the end. Maybe this is sick but this is how the movie portrayed them. Come on, Baby likes tooty fruity ice cream. You can't help but to root for her. This movie also had the feeling to it that it was filmed in the 70's. It's hard to explain but it had that Texas Chainsaw, Friday the 13th, The Hills Have Eyes feel to it. All around a great flick for the horror fan who can appreciate it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Devil's Rejects", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2079392025", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFlMjgxNWYtMGJlZC00MzQ3LTg0NzMtMjJkOGZhMGE2ODI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFlMjgxNWYtMGJlZC00MzQ3LTg0NzMtMjJkOGZhMGE2ODI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:39:13Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395584", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Devils-Rejects", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Devils-Rejects/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Devils-Rejects/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Devils-Rejects/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Devils-Rejects/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
