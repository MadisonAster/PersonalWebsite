Writer/Director Rob Zombie is obviously a great fan of 70s drive-in fare like \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" and \"The Hills Have Eyes\" and has learned his lessons well. He has a solid directorial style and a great ear for comically profane dialog - the banter in this movie reminds me of \"Goodfellas\" with maniacal Southern rednecks rather than East Coast Italian mobsters. And with a cast that includes William Forsythe, Sid Haig, Geoffrey Lewis, Ginger Lynn Allen, Priscilla Barnes, Steve Railsback, P.J. Soles, Mary Waronov, Deborah Van Valkenburgh, and Michael Berryman, and a Super 70s Soundtrack featuring The Allman Brothers, The James Gang, David Essex, and Lynyrd Skynyrd among others - you know Zombie has his pop cultural/cult movie references in order. I enjoyed this movie more for the humor than the for the \"horror\". The characters are all named after various Marx Brothers characters and while the gore is graphic and there are some truly chilling images in the movie, Zombie just misses the \"beat\" to put some of these sequences over the top, while the acting performances by a couple of the leads - namely Zombie look-alike Bill Mosely and Zombie's utterly babe-o-licious wife Sherri Moon Zombie - are less than stellar (although in Ms. Zombie's case it doesn't really matter - major eye candy!). So, a \"qualified\" recommendation for those who don't normally go for this kind of movie but who think they might enjoy it based on the description above. I thoroughly enjoyed it myself and think Rob Zombie is a genuinely talented filmmaker who will eventually hit one out of the ballpark if he keeps at it, which I'm sure he will. He comes pretty darned close with \"The Devil's Rejects\"."}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Devil's Rejects", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2079392025", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFlMjgxNWYtMGJlZC00MzQ3LTg0NzMtMjJkOGZhMGE2ODI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFlMjgxNWYtMGJlZC00MzQ3LTg0NzMtMjJkOGZhMGE2ODI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:39:13Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0395584", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Devils-Rejects", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Devils-Rejects/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Devils-Rejects/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Devils-Rejects/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Devils-Rejects/thumb.jpg"}
