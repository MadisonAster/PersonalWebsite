Naturally dilemmas occur in every direction for Sheen as the lifestyle he wants comes at a very heavy price (both literally and figuratively). A strained relationship with his father (real-life dad Martin Sheen) and a whirlwind fling with the superficial Daryl Hannah just leads to more and more cinematic fireworks. \"Wall Street\" is really the only film I can think of to deal seriously with its subject matter. Everyone of the age remembers the yuppie phase this nation had in the mid-1980s. Young urban professionals did their best to make as much as they could as fast as possible (sometimes through crooked and illegal means). The idea of retiring at 40 seemed like a good notion, but those same people with those thoughts are still working today (they never made their millions or they made their money and ended up going into a lifetime of debt because they spent their earnings quicker than they could make it). Ultimately the 1980s was good while it lasted, but good like that never lasts forever and that becomes painfully clear as Sheen's character becomes a warning to all those who think they can out-think and manipulate a strained economic system. Douglas is a complete revelation. I mean there is no doubt that he is an excellent performer, but his portrayal of a money- and power-mad player in New York is truly one of those instances of classic career work being achieved. Super-slick, wickedly intelligent and definitely a thinking person's movie, \"Wall Street\" continues to strike a chord when looking back at a very unique time of American economic history. 4.5 out of 5 stars."}, "duration": "PT2H6M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Wall Street", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3554738457", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU4ZDc2Y2QtMTg3Ny00NzM4LWIyOTMtODU0N2Y3YzMyNTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU4ZDc2Y2QtMTg3Ny00NzM4LWIyOTMtODU0N2Y3YzMyNTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-18T12:00:39Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Wall-Street", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Wall-Street/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Wall-Street/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Wall-Street/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
