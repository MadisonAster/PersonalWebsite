Good supporting cast includes Sean Young, James Spader, reliable Hal Holbrook, and the wonderful Sylvia Miles.  Tight direction, perceptive script with realistic techno-lingo, fabulous production design, dazzling cinematography of the Manhattan skyline, and hip 80's music rev up the technical quality of this Oliver Stone \"message\" film.  If only the message had been more reassuring.\n\nGekko is a villain and an outlaw, but mostly he comes across to viewers as a worldly tough guy, a charming bully with a glamorous lifestyle.  We see his high-class mega-office, his plush home and chic wife, his expensive paintings, his rapid-fire commands to his robotic lieutenants, his snazzy clothes and \"in vogue\" friends.  Here and there we see his frustrations, but that only accentuates his toughness.  We do not see him suffer, nor do we see the consequences of his selfish, Machiavellian behavior.\n\nAs a result, to viewers, especially to those youthful, bright, materialistic Americans with a smug, \"can do\" attitude, and disdain for ethics, Gekko is, unfortunately, someone to admire, a Wall Street role model.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H6M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Wall Street", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3554738457", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU4ZDc2Y2QtMTg3Ny00NzM4LWIyOTMtODU0N2Y3YzMyNTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU4ZDc2Y2QtMTg3Ny00NzM4LWIyOTMtODU0N2Y3YzMyNTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-18T12:00:39Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094291", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Wall-Street", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Wall-Street/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Wall-Street/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Wall-Street/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Wall-Street/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
