It is also filled with really great dry wit. I also really liked the funny cartoons used to present a lot of the material. \n\nI would, however, really like to hear some serious academic criticisms of the theories presented in this film, although I'm pretty sure that the film intended to be a bit over the top about how beer made the modern world. \n\nStill, this is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen--it was just so fun to watch. I really can't imagine anyone who wouldn't like watching this. Both entertaining and educational.
