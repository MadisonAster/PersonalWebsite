Was barley made exclusively for beer and not for bread? I do not know, but it seems a bit odd. Even the theory of how beer was accidentally discovered relies heavily on speculation.\n\nBut overall, it is pretty decent with real experts explaining things about beer's history that are not well known. Did it \"save\" the world? I do not know. I mean, sure, beer was safer to drink than bacteria-filled water... but clearly other societies thrived besides the Europeans. The world was not \"saved\".", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8", "worstRating": "1"}}, "url": "/title/tt1832368/", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
