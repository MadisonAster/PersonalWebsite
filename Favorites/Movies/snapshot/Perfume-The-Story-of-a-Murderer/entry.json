Out of incomprehension? Or out of hate because they've never read the book?\n\nNevertheless, this film wasn't meant to be exclusive for the book reader. It's a good film. You just gotta lay back and enjoy it. Doesn't need extra focus like watching The Prestige (2006). I bet so many people who hated this film were trying to figure out what happened half of it and forgot to enjoy.\n\nI've read the book when I was 16 yo and recommended it to my friend and he told me there's a film based on the book that I didn't know exists. I bought the DVD and I'm not disappointed. Pleased even. It's hard to imagine a 16th century Paris but when I saw the film I thought, 'that's how I would've imagine it!'. And when I read the name Jean-Baptiste Grenouille I didn't see any face. I characterized the name. But when I saw Ben Wishaw, it's like, I knew it'd be him.\n\nYes, some scenes aren't similar compared to the book. But it's still good. The pace is slow but necessary. Oftentimes based on books film turned out disappointing. This one isn't. For those who haven't read the book, don't worry, just enjoy it, you don't miss out on anything.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H27M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4003135769", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQxYzE3ZTAtMTg0MC00MzlhLTgwZTEtNzBmNjkyZjBmZTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQxYzE3ZTAtMTg0MC00MzlhLTgwZTEtNzBmNjkyZjBmZTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:23:03Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0396171", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Perfume-The-Story-of-a-Murderer", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Perfume-The-Story-of-a-Murderer/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Perfume-The-Story-of-a-Murderer/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Perfume-The-Story-of-a-Murderer/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Perfume-The-Story-of-a-Murderer/thumb.jpg"}
