I guess these people are only into mindless action-movies with simple dialog where people get slaughtered in a brutal and visually gory way. If you have a mind and you are able to think, this movie maybe something for you. The characters in the movie are strong, you sympathize with them easily. It is upsetting why the main character is killing the girls, as it is actually unnecessary. The sceneries and costumes look great. I felt like I was there. The movie shows moderate violence, which is all just suggestive, you don't see any blood. I give this movie 8 points. It is a good movie, which I'd recommend to my friends.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H27M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4003135769", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQxYzE3ZTAtMTg0MC00MzlhLTgwZTEtNzBmNjkyZjBmZTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQxYzE3ZTAtMTg0MC00MzlhLTgwZTEtNzBmNjkyZjBmZTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:23:03Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0396171", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Perfume-The-Story-of-a-Murderer", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Perfume-The-Story-of-a-Murderer/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Perfume-The-Story-of-a-Murderer/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Perfume-The-Story-of-a-Murderer/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-12-22"}
