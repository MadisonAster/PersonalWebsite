And I have to say, I liked it. For sure, it wasn't as good as the book. On the one hand it is hard to visualize smells and on the other hand not everything can be shown during the movie. But for me, it was realized pretty well. Even you can not smell the things, you can imagine how they smell which may be due to the camera work, which was well done! For me, the actors did a really good job, too. They played their roles really good and according to Grenouille, I really thought that he was the Grenouille described in the book. The only \"negative\" thing I can say about that, is that in the book he is described as an ugly person, but Ben Wishow is not ugly. But to me, that didn't really matter. So, all in all I have to say, that the movie isn't as good as the book (which is mostly the case), but although I think that it is a really good made movie.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H27M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Perfume: The Story of a Murderer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4003135769", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQxYzE3ZTAtMTg0MC00MzlhLTgwZTEtNzBmNjkyZjBmZTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQxYzE3ZTAtMTg0MC00MzlhLTgwZTEtNzBmNjkyZjBmZTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:23:03Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0396171", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Perfume-The-Story-of-a-Murderer", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Perfume-The-Story-of-a-Murderer/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Perfume-The-Story-of-a-Murderer/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Perfume-The-Story-of-a-Murderer/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Perfume-The-Story-of-a-Murderer/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-12-22"}
