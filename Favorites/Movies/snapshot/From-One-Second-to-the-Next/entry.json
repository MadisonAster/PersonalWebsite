I've got one but is rarely used to send calls only to receive them . Since I only have a cheap one that cost 10 pounds sterling it's difficult to send text on it and have never learned to send text . Astonishing I know but no big deal , and yet some people seem to exist only to receive and send text messages . Has anyone here walked through the busy concourse of an airport and had to dodge numerous idiots with their ugly faces buried in their mobile as they type a text message . If they had brains they'd be dangerous . If they had a car they'd would be potential killers and this documentary by Werner Herzog shows why\n\nFROM ONE SECOND TO THE NEXT isn't perhaps a fitting title because my reading of the title suggests that it may mean it only takes a second of carelessness of texting to cause irredeemable carnage and lifelong grief to a stranger who has done you no harm and who you didn't know even existed till you ran in to them . Perhaps the title can also mean that the whole universe has changed - and not for the better - for someone within that second ? It's a rather ambiguous title and one that doesn't work very well \n\nJudging a documentary by its title is like judging a book by its cover and its content that is of paramount importance . In this case Herzog grabs you right from the start . We're shown a black mother of a child who is the victim and a driver who hit her son while texting . She explains her high hopes for her son who was going to excel at sport but that dream is now over . . There is a knock on the door and she exclaims her son is back from school and you can may be second guess as to what will be revealed next . Sure enough her son's helper has brought him back from school - by pushing his wheelchair . The documentary continues along the same lines . The much loved sister who has been left brain damaged by a texting driver , the blacksmith who has had to give up the job he loved after having vertebrae broken by a texting driver and the daughter who was about to be married and lost her father to a texting driver just before the wedding \n\nSo far so sad and just in case you aren't moved by these stories of real life tragedy depressing music is played on the soundtrack ( Not sure if I've picked Bob up wrong as to \" fake music \" but the copy I saw did have a musical track ) and all this is very hard hitting and the emotional equivalent of getting kicked in the teeth . . Strange then that Herzog feels the need to include the stories of two drivers who have killed people while texting . Before you say I'll say it \" That's because he's showing the trauma caused to people who have instigated a tragic accident . There lives have been ruined and will have to carry the guilt for the rest of their life \" I doubt if that's the point of their inclusion however . What Herzog is doing deliberately or accidentally is making a film about redemption and forgiveness . One instigator of a fatal text driving incident that killed three children from the Amish community receives a letter from the bereaved father telling him that God is watching over him while another fatal instigator is met by the daughter of a man he killed . I'm afraid that if you kill someone it is forever and the more likely response is life long hatred from the families of people you killed especially if it's down to something as stupid as texting while driving which is no different from getting drunk and driving a car . Would we feel sympathy for drunk drivers involved in fatal crashes ? . Of course not and I guess this might be the reason why it hasn't been nominated for an Oscar in the short documentary category", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6", "worstRating": "1"}}, "url": "/title/tt3108864/", "EntryAdded": "2013-12-19"}
