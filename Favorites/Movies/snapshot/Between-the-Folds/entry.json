This film, at last, gives us a peek into a world of artists, scientists, mathematicians, educators and, of course, those that have the desire to simply fold paper. New horizons in medicine use origami to save lives. Teaching methods improve a child's ability to learn math. Complex mathematics are described with modular and curved folding. Industrial designers have made products for our daily lives. Molecular biologists are folding DNA! Vanessa Gould's lens shows us how this ancient art has developed as she interviews many of today's leading figures. This is the first (and only) film ever made on the subject.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT56M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1253565", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Between-the-Folds", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Between-the-Folds/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Between-the-Folds/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Between-the-Folds/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Between-the-Folds/thumb.jpg"}
