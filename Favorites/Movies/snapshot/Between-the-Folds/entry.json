The other creative wonder is the film itself, which takes us on a journey from a square of paper to the inside of the minds of creative artists. The film is, in some ways, a work of origami too, for it's folded into different sections, and the whole is even greater than the sum of its parts. If you can catch it at a film festival, don't miss it. And I'm sure this film, by a talented first-time filmmaker, will end up in other venues, win awards, and hopefully someday be available on DVD.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT56M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1253565", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Between-the-Folds", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Between-the-Folds/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Between-the-Folds/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Between-the-Folds/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Between-the-Folds/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-25"}
