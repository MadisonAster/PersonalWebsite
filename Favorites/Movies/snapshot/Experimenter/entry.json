Yes it was a tad slow but it only felt like that to me after I had watched it. I was immediately drawn in by the whole setup of the experiment and with the progression of the rest of them. This won't get anyone's heart pumping or racing but nonetheless I was glued to the screen with what this movie was trying to show me. I was so fascinated by the whole idea of it, that putting up with any of the 'slow' parts seemed quite easy. If you're in any way interested in human nature and how or why people could bring themselves to do certain things, you'll definitely appreciate this film.\n\nI didn't know anything about this man or his experiments but I always wondered about the very same things he did in regards to the tragedy's he spoke of and others. How can people slaughter others or commit heinous acts, bring themselves to do these things and then simply claim they were only the messenger? I believe it's definitely worth a watch to anyone.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3726704", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Experimenter", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Experimenter/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Experimenter/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Experimenter/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Experimenter/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-10-16"}
