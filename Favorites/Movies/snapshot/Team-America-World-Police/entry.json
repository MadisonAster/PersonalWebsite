I wish it didn't offend some but it does. So, if you want to know whether you will enjoy this film or not, you must answer \"yes\" to the following:\n\n1. I am not offended by the \"F\" word. Being repeated 300 times.\n\n2. I am not offended by intense marionette sex.\n\n3. I am not offended by racial satire.\n\n4. I am not offended by ridiculous political satire.\n\n5. I am not a member of the Film Actor's Guild.\n\nIf you're like me and have answered \"yes\" to the above five questions, go see this film. You will laugh so hard it will hurt and you will giggle about it for the next week thereafter.\n\nI have to say that I am very desensitized when it comes these kinds of films, and I'd say that Team America has raised the bar in derogatory humor.
