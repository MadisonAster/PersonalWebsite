Helps a bit if your politically savvy and know a bit about the Hollywood political types, yet either way, if you like South Park type of humor, your in for a load full of laughs.\n\nThey creatively took most every corny film shot you could think of, plenty of down right nasty language, marionettes getting shot and blown up in some pretty disgusting ways, parody songs that would make anyone blush, pop shots at world leaders, actors (big time), and anyone else you could think of and hit a home run with this as far as I'm concerned.\n\nI wont say anymore except that these guys did a great job with this idea and I think it's going to make a mint! If you take it all in humorous perspective and not personally, (have some fun with it), this movie can take the laugh breath right out of you. As it did the whole audience just within the first 15 minutes without even a chance for a second breath.\n\nCrude, rude, shrewd, corny, sexual, homophobic, nasty and irreverent will only begin to describe...\"Team America World Police\" I hope you enjoy it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Team America: World Police", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1166541081", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTEyYmRkYWMtZDMxYi00MmRhLThkZTYtYTgyNzg2MzEwODQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTEyYmRkYWMtZDMxYi00MmRhLThkZTYtYTgyNzg2MzEwODQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:06:52Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372588", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Team-America-World-Police", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Team-America-World-Police/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Team-America-World-Police/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Team-America-World-Police/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
