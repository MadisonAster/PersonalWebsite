It blew me away years ago, but I find it even more stunning now. Not just because of the writing, Sidney Lumet's taut direction or the Oscar-caliber performances by everyone involved, all of which are almost beyond being lauded with superlatives.\n\nBut what knocks me out is how Chayefsky seemed less to be writing from the power of his imagination, than channeling Our Times Now. As if he was capable of some form of mental time travel; able to look into the Nineties and beyond to see the coming of SURVIVOR, or Maury Povich, Jerry Springer, Bill O'Reilly and Paris Hilton. Even HE probably didn't know how he knew, but he sure as hell felt it and wrote it down for us to marvel over today.\n\nSure, there are political and cultural analogies throughout the picture that are dated. But the core of his vision remains startlingly clear and eerily prophetic. As for Howard Beale, there is not one single \"celebrity\" who mirrors that character today, but maybe he is a composite of several different personalities with whom we have become all too familiar in the world of \"news-fo-tainment.\" Or maybe he simply hasn't materialized yet. Maybe that is just how far ahead of its time NETWORK really was.\n\nAfter all, being \"mad as hell\" nowadays has so many more layers of meaning than it did nearly thirty years ago...", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H1M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074958", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Network", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Network/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Network/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Network/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Network/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
