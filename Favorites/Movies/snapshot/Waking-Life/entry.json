Filming people, then having artists with different styles \"animate\" the recorded scenes was brilliant. The visuals are constantly changing, providing an aurora of sights that you can not take your eyes off of. Trippy? Yes, Burnt Out? No- This movie can not only be appreciated for the wild images, but for the story-line as well... On second thought-story-line might not be the right word. The actual \"plot\" of this movie can be seen as an hour and a half of the most interesting philosophy course one can find. The characters and conversations are deep, fascinating, and thought-provoking. You must see this movie more than once because it is almost impossible to absorb what you see and be able to fully appreciate the genius of the script.  I've seen it about 5 times and there are still some scenes I have yet to fully grasp. Sit back and treat your eyes and mind to the most stimulating film of the year.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Waking Life", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2734358809", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdlMmY2OTktMTJmMi00YjJiLWJkM2UtZWFmZTFhNmI2YzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdlMmY2OTktMTJmMi00YjJiLWJkM2UtZWFmZTFhNmI2YzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:16:16Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243017", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waking-Life", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waking-Life/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waking-Life/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waking-Life/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
