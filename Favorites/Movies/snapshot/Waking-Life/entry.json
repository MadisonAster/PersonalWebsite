If you don't have a spiritual bone in your body, avoid. It has its flaws, but only in retrospect or through the eyes of another will they be found--and then forgiven if you have even an ounce of heart or a particle of transcendence.\n\nIt gets beneath one's radar and past one's filters.\n\nFor instance, it hits you perceptually with constantly varying animation styles, and after some time, you adjust to this so much that when you leave the theater, THE WORLD IS ANIMATED--a poetic way of saying that your connection to the proposition that all things are real is loosen WONDERFULLY!\n\nAnd then, it hits you intellectually by parading a dozen+ viewpoints of persons who would not necessarily disagree with one another, but show the vast importance to us of the personal way we manifest our philosophical axioms and how much that depends on our individual interests-not all of us are psychologically constructed to be philosophers, but all of us can be analyzed to have a philosophical set of suppositions. Waking Life challenges these suppositions by merely presenting to you, in dramatic form, persons who vividly present their `takes' on the concepts and how they are impacted by them...especially emotionally.\n\nUltimately, this is not a movie, and it shouldn't be viewed as such; instead, one should approach it as therapy. See it, be with it, relax, and GROW. Every time you see it again, the concepts saturate your nervous system with reinforcing patterns that will later \"echo\" in your dynamics in synergistic ways. A seed gets planted and with repeated viewings the seed gets watered.\n\nGo to this event. See it from a seat that's within the first ten rows of the theater; immerse yourself. Let go. All you have to lose (loosen) is identification with a reflection of the real you."}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Waking Life", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2734358809", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdlMmY2OTktMTJmMi00YjJiLWJkM2UtZWFmZTFhNmI2YzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdlMmY2OTktMTJmMi00YjJiLWJkM2UtZWFmZTFhNmI2YzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:16:16Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243017", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waking-Life", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waking-Life/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waking-Life/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waking-Life/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waking-Life/thumb.jpg"}
