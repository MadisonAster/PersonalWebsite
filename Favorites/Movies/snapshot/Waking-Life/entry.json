It's also visually stunning and perfectly acted: every single one of these people seem to be just giving their own opinions as if you were overhearing/having a meaningful conversation with them. \n\nWe can chalk this up to the genius of Linklater who over the years has shown not only the pretentiously humorous coffee house crowd cliches but also the searching, often deeply insightful side of our generation that the media overlooked when we were dubbed slackers. In films he has written: \"Slacker\" and \"Before Sunrise\" and in his films of stage plays Bogosian's brilliant, Chekhovian \"SubUrbia\" and the faintly melodramatic \"Tape\", Linklater has always been fascinated with the question of what we should doing with our lives. Our responsibility is to contribute something lasting and meaningful to our society. But what exactly is that? Where and when should I do it? Who with? How do I know if I've really found it? Why is it so important again, anyway?\n\n I saw this movie for the first time late last night and 5 minutes before it started I had fallen asleep and was hoping I'd be able to make it all the way through the film. From the first frame I was riveted and completely awake and remained so even after it was over; contemplating all the myriad viewpoints the film had thrown at me.\n\nThis movie is so exciting and bursting with ideas that I'm going to buy the DVD as soon as I possibly can and watch it over and over trying to absorb it all.\n\nSee this film. It will remind you of how thrilling it is to be an active thinking, feeling member of the human race.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Waking Life", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2734358809", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdlMmY2OTktMTJmMi00YjJiLWJkM2UtZWFmZTFhNmI2YzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdlMmY2OTktMTJmMi00YjJiLWJkM2UtZWFmZTFhNmI2YzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:16:16Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0243017", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waking-Life", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waking-Life/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waking-Life/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waking-Life/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waking-Life/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
