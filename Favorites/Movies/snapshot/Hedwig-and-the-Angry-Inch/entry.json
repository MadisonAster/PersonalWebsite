Hilarious, in fact. Hedwig, the lead character, spews some fabulous one-liners (\"One day in the late mid-80's, I was in my early late-20's;\" \"How did some slip of a girly-boy from communist East Berlin become the internationally-ignored song-stylist barely standing in front of you?\"). And watching Midwesterners react to Hedwig had me laughing out loud. The movie's second and equally important feature is the music -- clever, tuneful songs ranging across the spectrum from hard-rock to country ballads. The best is \"Origins of Love\", a song spun from a writing by Plato (true!) and illustrated with apt animation. Finally, this film has a message, urging acceptance of our inner selves. You can't ask for more than this! \"Hedwig...\" delivers in poignancy, entertainment and punch."}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Hedwig and the Angry Inch", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3786146073", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3MjMzMzEwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjM2ODY2MQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3MjMzMzEwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjM2ODY2MQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A transexual punk rock girl from East Berlin tours the US with her rock band as she tells her life story and follows the ex-boyfriend/bandmate who stole her songs.", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:25:24Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0248845", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Hedwig-and-the-Angry-Inch", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Hedwig-and-the-Angry-Inch/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Hedwig-and-the-Angry-Inch/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Hedwig-and-the-Angry-Inch/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
