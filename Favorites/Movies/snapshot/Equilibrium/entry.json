As usual, I was practicing my theory of \"lowered expectations.\"  I expect a movie to be horribly awful ahead of time, so I can not be disappointed.  I was not disappointed. At the end of the film I could not sit still in my seat.  I felt the urge to go out into the world and proclaim the utter awesomeness of \"Equilibrium.\"  Such words as \"Sweet,\" \"Crazy,\" and \"Righteous\" sprang forth from my lips in rapid succession when I talked about the movie with my friends. Not since the \"Fellowship of the Ring\" have I desired to sing a movie's praises.  And I mean literally SING.  \"Equilibrium\" could, and should, be the sleeper hit of the year.  The film's action sequences stir up the blood and pump the adrenaline as if you were riding a roller-coaster.  The art style, while minimalistic, and thus maybe confused for low-budget by some, is actually quite successful in portraying a totalitarian and emotionless society.  The acting is excellent as well, and quite possibly the best I have seen in an action film in long time. While the nay-sayers will say that the film is too unoriginal, borrowing elements of its story and premise from \"Fahrenheit 451\" and \"Brave New World,\" these complaints can be disregarded as the movie adds enough of its own style and story to make the comparisons plausible in basic premise only. In the end, like any movie, \"Equilibrium\" is meant as entertainment. And entertain it does. It does it so very well.  It mixes action and with substantial plot and original style to make an excellent whole.  Go see it. Go see it twice.  Go see \"Equilibrium,\" Cleric.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Equilibrium", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi368025113", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2011-10-26T03:19:50Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0238380", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Equilibrium", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Equilibrium/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Equilibrium/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Equilibrium/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Equilibrium/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
