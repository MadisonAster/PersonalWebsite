Think of it as film noir amped up for a post modern century. It comes across like most of Frank Miller's writing, modestly fantastic for the comic environment, but steeped long and hard in the tradition of the underground crime writers of the '40's. Visually, the juxtaposition of the rich B&W with digitally-hued Technicolor makes it hard to take your eyes off the screen. This film was tailor made for most of the people who have been following Miller's writing for the past twenty odd years, brimming with many of his trademark elements and visual style that he, along with Messrs. Rodriguez and Tarantino, capture brilliantly. Not for more sensitive or under aged souls, Sin City will burn like a fire that you have to watch for everyone else.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Sin City", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi667983385", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQ1YmQ4ZjItZWMyZS00YjUwLTgxYmUtODNhYmIwZWNjYzY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQ1YmQ4ZjItZWMyZS00YjUwLTgxYmUtODNhYmIwZWNjYzY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2011-10-26T03:46:07Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401792", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sin-City", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sin-City/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sin-City/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sin-City/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sin-City/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
