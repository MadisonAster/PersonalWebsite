The trouble is that there is no story here, merely a concept. This would have been a great method of pitching an idea to a studio, but as a short it falls somewhat short. (Pun intended)\n\nIt tells the tale of a robot that once served a family, but after losing their love he proceeds to try and \"fix\" people believing them broken and does it in a less than pleasant manner.\n\nThe script is great and in some sick twisted way you can totally empathise, for that reason I actually found myself more than a little saddened by the premise but doubly so when I realised there wasn't going to be an actual story here.\n\nSure shorts have limitations imposed on them due to the length but they can still have a beginning/middle/end and this doesn't.\n\nSomeone pick this concept up and make a feature film out of it!\n\nThe Good:\n\nLooks great \n\nWell written\n\nExcellent premise\n\nThe Bad:\n\nNo real structure\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nThis furthers my stance on robots and my stance is NO\n\nThis would make a wicked twist for a Bicentennial Man 2", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT9M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2883236", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/ABE", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/ABE/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/ABE/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/ABE/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/ABE/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-12-12"}
