I just watched it three times straight through, and that's not normal. As a film, it's technically fine (music, direction, camera), even though it's an \"amateur\" production. I take some issue with the editing, however as it relates to the story-telling. Part of why I had to watch it a few times is that I wasn't figuring out what was going on. Portions were hard to follow or just not spelled out when they needed to be. I don't need hand-holding, but there's a lot of technical information to absorb in this one and I wish a few scenes were a bit more clear. But that adds mystery, I guess.\n\nI found the dialog to be extremely believable and it made me really believe that this could be something actually happening. That's part of what makes it haunting for me, I guess.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8", "worstRating": "1"}}, "url": "/title/tt0390384/", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
