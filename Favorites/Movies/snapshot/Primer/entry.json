I just watched it three times straight through, and that's not normal. As a film, it's technically fine (music, direction, camera), even though it's an \"amateur\" production. I take some issue with the editing, however as it relates to the story-telling. Part of why I had to watch it a few times is that I wasn't figuring out what was going on. Portions were hard to follow or just not spelled out when they needed to be. I don't need hand-holding, but there's a lot of technical information to absorb in this one and I wish a few scenes were a bit more clear. But that adds mystery, I guess.\n\nI found the dialog to be extremely believable and it made me really believe that this could be something actually happening. That's part of what makes it haunting for me, I guess.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H17M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Primer", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Primer/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Primer/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Primer/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Primer/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
