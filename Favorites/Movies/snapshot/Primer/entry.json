This movie is obviously not for the casual viewer who sees movies as a strictly one-way experience. Primer requires a willingness to engage it as it conveys a carefully constructed puzzle of events that are not necessarily chronological. And it requires the audience to make the necessary leaps of intuition and deduction to put that puzzle together. It probably doesn't help that the language and tone of the movie is extremely technical, filmed and directed to capture the true-to-life mannerisms and speech of two college physics graduate students. But if you can grasp the premise presented in the introduction, you should be able to follow the movie up until the point where it leaves you in the dust near the end, wondering, as Abe, \"How?\". You realize that what you have seen is significant, but the full scope of it eludes you. And that makes the subsequent re-watching and investigation and ultimate realization of the true nature of the puzzle all the more rewarding.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H17M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390384", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Primer", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Primer/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Primer/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Primer/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
