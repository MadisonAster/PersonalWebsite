The characters at first looked slightly strange but I found myself very much pulled into their world. The World War One setting makes for very sparse and atmospheric animation. The sound design was very strong. The detail with the German language was very amusing. There a piece three-quarters of the way through where the main character is very hopeless and alone in the war-zone surrounded by death with a screaming baby. This was the bit that made me cry. The true story element gave me cause to gasp when the photograph of the actual soldier was revealed at the end. I wouldn't say that this is a film for children.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10", "worstRating": "1"}}, "url": "/title/tt1458968/", "EntryAdded": "2016-01-29"}
