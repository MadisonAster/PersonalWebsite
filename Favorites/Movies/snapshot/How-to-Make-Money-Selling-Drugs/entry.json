Whether you believe in decriminalizing drugs or not, the film gives nuggets of perspective that allow the audience to go on a path of discovery of their own, while still maintaining the film's own voice. The actual delivery of the message was the highlight for me. The film follows people from all walks of life - giving the audience a well-rounded, well researched and well conceived view. I find that many documentaries, especially on such controversial topics, can come out one-sided, but this is a true exception where you never feel forced to feel a certain way, but come out forming your own opinions that somehow mesh with the film's core values. \n\nSo, in sum, brilliant!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "How to Make Money Selling Drugs", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3497305625", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5MjYxNTYzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY0NDQ4MjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5MjYxNTYzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY0NDQ4MjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A shockingly candid examination of how a street dealer can rise to cartel lord with relative ease, How to Make Money Selling Drugs is an insider\u00c2\u2019s guide to the violent but extremely lucrative drug industry.
