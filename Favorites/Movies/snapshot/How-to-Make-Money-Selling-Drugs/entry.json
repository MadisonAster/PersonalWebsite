How to make money selling drugs is everything that any good documentary or movie, in general, should be. \n\nThe creativity and originality of this movie stood out to me right away and all throughout the film. In a world where everything is re-make or recreation of something from the past, it was totally refreshing and fascinating to finally see a film that brings creativity to the forefront. \n\nThe talent was phenomenal and interesting from start to finish. It was also brilliantly shot and executed. I was blown away by this documentary and cannot say enough good things.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "How to Make Money Selling Drugs", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3497305625", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5MjYxNTYzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY0NDQ4MjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5MjYxNTYzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY0NDQ4MjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A shockingly candid examination of how a street dealer can rise to cartel lord with relative ease, How to Make Money Selling Drugs is an insider\u00c2\u2019s guide to the violent but extremely lucrative drug industry.
