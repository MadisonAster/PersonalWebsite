The title makes you think that it's going to be an A-Z of becoming a drug lord, but basically it shows you the different sides of selling and taking narcotics and how the government isn't really helping the situation. I learnt a lot from this film. It really does show that things really aren't black and white. When you see the amount of money that the government are getting in there budgets to fight drug crime to what they are actually doing against the war on drugs, there is definitely something wrong. The Eminem and 50 Cent bonus interview was touching and some of the ex-drug king pins really do show that it really doesn't pay to get into that world. Anyway, it's a great documentary that is definitely worth a watch. \n\nRound-Up: The other great thing about this documentary is that it shows that there are many addictions that are legal, that cause much more problems than drug addiction. When I saw that statistics about how many people are dying from smoking, it was really scary and as a smoker, it did make me think twice. I also couldn't believe that 25% of the world prisoners are in America which really does show that they have a serious problem. Anyway, I don't want to spoil the documentary for anyone so just watch it and get back to me with your views.\n\nBudget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $40,000 (Deserved More!)\n\nI recommend this movie to people who are interested in the mind behind a drug dealer and the up and down sides of that world. 7/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "How to Make Money Selling Drugs", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3497305625", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5MjYxNTYzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY0NDQ4MjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5MjYxNTYzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDY0NDQ4MjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A shockingly candid examination of how a street dealer can rise to cartel lord with relative ease, How to Make Money Selling Drugs is an insider\u00c2\u2019s guide to the violent but extremely lucrative drug industry.
