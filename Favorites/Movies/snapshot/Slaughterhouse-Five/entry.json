The actor who played Billy Pilgrim captured Billy's passive, calm and vaguely anti-social demeanor. Lazarro, Montana and Billy's wife are also well played. \n\nGeorge Roy Hill had a knack for directing movies made from great books -- e.g., \"The World According to Garp\" -- and in the end, I was pleasantly surprised how well this movie turned out. \n\nAs far as the Vonnegut adaptations go (I know of four -- this one, \"Mother Night,\" \"Breakfast of Champions\" and the god-awful \"Slapstick\") this one is the best of the bunch. \n\nI've always wanted to see a movie version of \"Sirens of Titan,\" but it'll probably never happen -- so \"Slaughterhouse Five\" is my only chance to \"see\" Trafalmadore. \n\nRecommended to any true Vonnegut fans. Other people probably won't appreciate it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0069280", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Slaughterhouse-Five", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Slaughterhouse-Five/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Slaughterhouse-Five/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Slaughterhouse-Five/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
