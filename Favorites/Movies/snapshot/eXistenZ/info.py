            'reviewBody': 'After his almost disastrous "Crash", Cronenberg '
                          'returns to more familiar terrain with "eXistenZ". '
                          'After "Videodrome" and "Naked Lunch", this is now '
                          'his third movie featuring different levels of '
                          'reality which gradually mix with each other until '
                          "at the end, you don't know any more what reality "
                          'is. Nowadays, you cannot say any more that this is '
                          'a novel concept and, in addition, "eXistenZ" is '
                          'much tamer, much more mainstream, and much weaker '
                          'than "Naked Lunch" and, especially, Cronenberg\'s '
                          'masterpiece "Videodrome". There simply isn\'t '
                          'anything new which Cronenberg has to add to the '
                          'subject.\n'
                          '\n'
                          'Moreover, the fact that the movie deals with '
                          'computer gaming is misleading. First, the subject '
                          'was probably chosen to attract a new audience '
                          "(which isn't familiar with his previous movies). "
                          "Second, Cronenberg's visions aren't very much based "
                          'on what modern computer gaming really is, except, '
                          "maybe, for adventure games. In Cronenberg's movie, "
                          'the computer game allows you to enter another '
                          'reality which, however, looks very much  like the '
                          'reality you know, except that there seem to be '
                          'other rules. Modern computer gaming, in turn, has '
                          'already created a new reality which differs in its '
                          'very characteristics from the world we know. This '
                          'world is aggressive, fast paced, and the player as '
                          'individual is reduced to its capability of reacting '
                          'as fast as possible (this aspect is indeed captured '
                          'much more appropriately in the - much weaker movie '
                          '- "The Matrix"). Thus, Cronenberg\'s movie is more '
                          'a surrealist dream than a serious discussion of the '
                          'dangers of computer gaming. Of course, this is '
                          'prefectly legal. The game console is a means of '
                          'changing into another reality, just like the drugs '
                          'were in "Naked Lunch" and video tapes were in '
                          '"Videodrome". At other times, the console appears '
                          'more like a sexual fetish.\n'
                          '\n'
                          '"eXistenZ" has some interesting and remarkable '
                          'scenes such as the whole part in the "Trout Farm" '
                          'and the Chinese restaurant, but there are also '
                          'involuntarily ridicolous scenes such as the '
                          'character being stuck in a game loop. Overall, the '
                          'images which Cronenberg chooses do not have the '
                          'strength and impact of his older movies: The '
                          'central element, the organic console, just looks '
                          'like what it is: a piece of rubber. It is directly '
                          'hooked up to the spinal chord, an unpleasant idea, '
                          'but how much more impressive was the scene when '
                          'James Woods inserted the video tape into his own '
                          'stomach in "Videodrome". \n'
                          '\n'
                          'All in all, "eXistenZ" is another trip into the '
                          'weird world of David Cronenberg but into the more '
                          "civilized regions which doesn't give you many "
