After \"Videodrome\" and \"Naked Lunch\", this is now his third movie featuring different levels of reality which gradually mix with each other until at the end, you don't know any more what reality is. Nowadays, you cannot say any more that this is a novel concept and, in addition, \"eXistenZ\" is much tamer, much more mainstream, and much weaker than \"Naked Lunch\" and, especially, Cronenberg's masterpiece \"Videodrome\". There simply isn't anything new which Cronenberg has to add to the subject.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the movie deals with computer gaming is misleading. First, the subject was probably chosen to attract a new audience (which isn't familiar with his previous movies). Second, Cronenberg's visions aren't very much based on what modern computer gaming really is, except, maybe, for adventure games. In Cronenberg's movie, the computer game allows you to enter another reality which, however, looks very much  like the reality you know, except that there seem to be other rules. Modern computer gaming, in turn, has already created a new reality which differs in its very characteristics from the world we know. This world is aggressive, fast paced, and the player as individual is reduced to its capability of reacting as fast as possible (this aspect is indeed captured much more appropriately in the - much weaker movie - \"The Matrix\"). Thus, Cronenberg's movie is more a surrealist dream than a serious discussion of the dangers of computer gaming. Of course, this is prefectly legal. The game console is a means of changing into another reality, just like the drugs were in \"Naked Lunch\" and video tapes were in \"Videodrome\". At other times, the console appears more like a sexual fetish.\n\n\"eXistenZ\" has some interesting and remarkable scenes such as the whole part in the \"Trout Farm\" and the Chinese restaurant, but there are also involuntarily ridicolous scenes such as the character being stuck in a game loop. Overall, the images which Cronenberg chooses do not have the strength and impact of his older movies: The central element, the organic console, just looks like what it is: a piece of rubber. It is directly hooked up to the spinal chord, an unpleasant idea, but how much more impressive was the scene when James Woods inserted the video tape into his own stomach in \"Videodrome\". \n\nAll in all, \"eXistenZ\" is another trip into the weird world of David Cronenberg but into the more civilized regions which doesn't give you many surprises.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "eXistenZ", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi27656473", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc2NjZjZDctNmY2ZS00N2M4LTg0OTctNTE5ZTc1YzJiZjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc2NjZjZDctNmY2ZS00N2M4LTg0OTctNTE5ZTc1YzJiZjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for eXistenZ", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:03:21Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120907", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/eXistenZ", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/eXistenZ/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/eXistenZ/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/eXistenZ/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/eXistenZ/thumb.jpg"}
