That is, your reaction to this marvellous movie will depend whether you are S.F. literate and familiar with Cronenberg's oeuvre, or a 'Matrix'-loving, Johnny-come-lately. Now I enjoy 'The Matrix' as a superior action movie, but no movie in recent years has been so overrated, and grossly exaggerated as intellectual fare! 'eXistenZ' and Alex Proyas' similarly overlooked 'Dark City' are everything 'The Matrix' claims to be - intelligent, thought provoking, CHALLENGING S.F.\n\n This movie is almost a summary of all the themes and motifs that Cronenberg has been obsessed about for the last 25 years or so. Especially the Burroughsian \"biological horror\" and the Phildickian questioning of reality. While it echoes many of his previous movies, it especially evokes his masterpiece 'Videodrome'. It may not reach the hallucinogenic heights of that movie - very few have - but it certainly takes you to places most contemporary S.F. and horror movies don't even try to reach.\n\nHowever this movie isn't just Cronenberg rehashing his \"greatest hits\". There are more than enough new and interesting touches, especially the Rushdie-like Fatwah theme, the odd sexual symbolism, and the witty touches such as the bone guns that fire teeth. Helping all this along is the interesting, carefully chosen cast. All are good, but I especially like Willem Dafoe's creepy garage mechanic, and it was also great to see Canadian cult star Don McKellar ('Highway 61', 'Twitch City',etc) as the enigmatic \"Russian\" Yevgeny.\n\n'Videodrome' has taken many years to find its real audience, and maybe 'eXistenz' will too. But I believe eventually it will be recognised for what it is - a work of great imagination and flair."}, "duration": "PT1H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "eXistenZ", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi27656473", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc2NjZjZDctNmY2ZS00N2M4LTg0OTctNTE5ZTc1YzJiZjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc2NjZjZDctNmY2ZS00N2M4LTg0OTctNTE5ZTc1YzJiZjFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for eXistenZ", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:03:21Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120907", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/eXistenZ", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/eXistenZ/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/eXistenZ/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/eXistenZ/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-06-07"}
