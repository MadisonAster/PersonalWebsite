I saw it at the special premiere to the Grammy Recording Academy members a the WB studios in Burbank. It's an absolutely amazing story with a brilliant cast and a soundtrack that will blow you away. Apparently, both Freddie Highmore, keri russell,Jonathan Rhys Meyers learned most of the songs and played/sang them themselves, which is very impressive once you see the movie. John from five for fighting wrote a few songs on the soundtrack as well. Music is the common thread that keeps the entire movie together and completes it into the masterpiece of a movie that it is. Although at times, there may seem like there are gaps in the story line/character development, the point of this is that the music is what communicates those hidden details of the movie.Overall, this film is a masterpiece that should be cherished by music-lovers everywhere.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H54M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "August Rush", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi380764441", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4OTgzODMyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTk4NDQ4._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4OTgzODMyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTk4NDQ4._V1_.jpg", "description": "August Rush Trailer", "uploadDate": "2007-11-28T14:37:33Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426931", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/August-Rush", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/August-Rush/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/August-Rush/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/August-Rush/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/August-Rush/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
