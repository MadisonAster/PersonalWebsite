                          "manner of John Grisham's best legal thrillers, into "

                          'brilliant, spot-on portrayal of the corporate '
                          'executive-turned-FBI informant, as well as solid '

                          'about this movie, I was slightly skeptical. '
                          'Economics and law are far from my forte. However, '
                          'what I found was a story so ridiculous and told in '
                          'such a compelling way that it was difficult to put '
                          'the book down. Especially for a nonfiction story, '
                          'the characters felt so well-developed and so '
                          'three-dimensional that you cannot help but care '

                          'then, I heard that Soderbergh planned to make the '
                          'movie version into a dark comedy. Given some of the '
                          'subject matter and material involved, I was worried '
                          'that the film would turn into too much of a farce '
                          'and would not give the real-life story and people '

                          'undoubtedly lighter than its source material, '
                          'Soderbergh stayed true to reality, keeping the '
                          'events mostly accurate to what Eichenwald described '
                          'in his book, and hence, to what really happened; in '
                          'fact, on a side note, after seeing the movie, the '
                          'real-life Mark Whitacre commented that the film was '
                          '"very accurate", which is a bit of a surprise '
                          'considering Soderbergh made the decision to not '

                          'Oddly enough, while this probably sounds '
                          'contradictory to the opening statement of my '
                          'review, much of the humor actually springs out of '

                          'improvised by the director or actors. There are so '
                          'many hidden layers to the tale that, in retrospect, '

                          'at how it all unfolded. Of course, that is not to '
                          "say that Scott Z. Burns, who adapted Einchenwald's "
                          'book for the screen, did not do any work. The '
                          'screenplay does an admirable job of adhering to the '
                          'true events with enough creativity, wit and '
                          'originality to prevent the film from seeming like '
                          'just a retread of everything Einchenwald '

                          "filming, he perfectly captures Whitacre's "
                          'personality, mannerisms and attitude, making him '
                          'seem larger-than-life but at the same time, '
                          'completely and utterly human, while many other '
                          'actors might have made him too much of a '
                          'caricature. The supporting cast does a fine job as '

                          'a bit intrusive, this quaint style effectively '
