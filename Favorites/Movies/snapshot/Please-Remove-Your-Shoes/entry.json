It's main concern is to give the traveling public reassurance rather than actual safety.\n\nNarrated by former TSA agents and air marshals, this film gives an alarming insight into the reality of airport security. The testers of security (red team) who were beating security so often that they were withdrawn - they made the agency look bad. The focus on whistle-blowers rather than the real concerns which they illuminated. In one case the screeners caught the water bottle at the top of the bag, removed it and passed the bag back to the red team member with the assembled bomb still in place at the bottom of the bag.\n\nThis film is a damning indictment of the bureaucracy that is the TSA. It also should be a real worry to anyone who is planning on flying anytime soon.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H29M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Please Remove Your Shoes", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi152634393", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3ODUyMjMwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA3NTkxMw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI3ODUyMjMwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA3NTkxMw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Please Remove Your Shoes is a documentary about the US government's broken promise to keep our airlines secure, and the personal stories of a few people who know the truth - congressmen, air marshals, aviation security employees.
