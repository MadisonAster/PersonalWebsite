It's not a terrible effort, but I could see much more wasted potential than what the movie actually grabbed on and used. It gets to an okay start, having a little atmosphere and not taking too long to set up the situation the female heroine finds herself in. However, after that point, the movie quickly gets bogged down. Though the heroine is racing against time, I couldn't get that feeling at all - there is no feeling of tension or speed, and the heroine seems to be taking the situation more calmly than I think anyone else in her shoes would be feeling. The situation also feels too stretched out for its own good, even though the movie only has a running time of 85 minutes. As for the ending, I won't spoil what happens in the climax or conclusion, but I will say that I had a strong feeling of dissatisfaction from these final few minutes; there are a number of unanswered questions as well as future potential problems for the heroine that simply are not resolved. I guessed the movie is fairly well produced for its very low budget, but I would have accepted a less slick look for a stronger atmosphere and more suspense.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT1H25M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3448749849", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmE0YWZhZjMtNzgwZC00YTQ3LThjNzAtMWFmZDIwYzE2NTJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmE0YWZhZjMtNzgwZC00YTQ3LThjNzAtMWFmZDIwYzE2NTJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "When a single mother accepts the help of a mysterious woman after her daughter is bitten by a rattlesnake, she finds herself making an unthinkable deal to repay her debt.", "uploadDate": "2019-10-10T20:00:14Z"}, "Title": "Rattlesnake", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9257484", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Rattlesnake", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Rattlesnake/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Rattlesnake/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Rattlesnake/entry.json"}
