I'm actually disgusted with them making such low movies. Also most of the documentaries I watched never really does anything.\n\nI watched Nanjing! Nanjing! - City of Life and Death tonight and it really drained me emotionally, the movie really depicting the real face/real ugly side of war, where the victims are always the people, doesn't matter what wars or which countries.\n\nThe movie itself doesn't really do the finger pointing like other movies, but it just showing, in my opinion, the fair view on what was going on back then without taking sides.\n\nAnd it's show one thing, the most profound thing to me, that The Chinese people can endure a lot of hardship that life throw at them and that's possibly why their cultures and civilization last for a long time.\n\nHighly recommended for people who never really know this part of history, as Chinese I know about it, but for lot of my westerners friends who never been to China, they only heard about it but didn't realize how crazy it was and how significant is this event for the Chinese people. Most people know the atrocities the Nazis did in WWII, but not the Japanese Atrocities.\n\nWatched it and let's pray there won't be WW III or any wars at all actually.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H13M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "City of Life and Death", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3417376537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA4MzcxNTk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTcyOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDA4MzcxNTk2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTcyOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A dramatization of the rape of Nanking in 1937.", "uploadDate": "2010-04-07T06:45:18Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1124052", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/City-of-Life-and-Death", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/City-of-Life-and-Death/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/City-of-Life-and-Death/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/City-of-Life-and-Death/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/City-of-Life-and-Death/thumb.jpg"}
