The film is full of memorable moments such as the chase down Edinburgh's Princes Street which opens the film (I happened to be there when they were filming that scene) and Ewan McGregor diving down the \"Worst Toilet in Scotland\" headfirst.\n\nThe film doesn't condemn drug addicts, but it is probably more effective then any amount of preachy moralising as it depicts the devastating consequences that can happen to drug users.  \n\nThe film is well acted by a cast who have (mostly) become pretty famous since.  Especially memorable is Robert Carlyle as the violent Begbie.\n\nI have seen this film many times.  It is an instant classic.  Go check it out."}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trainspotting: Blu-Ray", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2148899865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGRmMWQxNTItNGQ5NC00OTY4LTgzZWUtNDEyMmY4OTFhM2EyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGRmMWQxNTItNGQ5NC00OTY4LTgzZWUtNDEyMmY4OTFhM2EyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Trainspotting", "uploadDate": "2011-08-20T03:47:24Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117951", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Trainspotting", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Trainspotting/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Trainspotting/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Trainspotting/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Trainspotting/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
