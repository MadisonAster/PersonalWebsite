But she is also and efficient CIA Operations Officer working in the Nonproliferation Center and in charge of several operations.\n\nIn 2003, when Bush administration manipulates the information relative to massive destruction weapons to justify the invasion of Iraq, Joe Wilson writes an article in the New York Times criticizing the government and telling that the intelligence research had been manipulated. In reprisal, the government leaks Valerie's identity to discredit Joe, affecting their professional and private lives and almost destroying their marriage.\n\n\"Fair Game\" is a bold film about the life of Valerie Plame Wilson, who has had her life destroyed by Bush administration in part of the farce about the existence of massive destruction weapons in Iraq to justify the invasion of that nation. But it seems that later the Wilson family wrote two books and won lawsuits against members of the government and they might have resolved their lives at least financially speaking.\n\nThe film glances also at the lives of Iraqi scientists that trusted on Valerie and were murdered by the Iraqi secret service, but does not show the fate of the civilian population that had their country bombed and invaded due to a farce. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Jogos de Poder\" (\"Power Game\")", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Fair Game", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3772581401", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MzU2NTM3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc1NzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MzU2NTM3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc1NzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "CIA operative Valerie Plame (Watts), who is investigating the existence of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq, discovers her identity allegedly leaked by the government as payback for an op-ed article her husband (Penn) wrote criticizing the Bush administration.", "uploadDate": "2010-08-20T12:21:40Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0977855", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fair-Game", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fair-Game/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fair-Game/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fair-Game/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-25"}
