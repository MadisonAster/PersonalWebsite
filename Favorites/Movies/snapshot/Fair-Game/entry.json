Director Doug Liman uses his Bourne Identity/Mr & Mrs Smith skills to move the true story of exposure of Valerie Plame (Naomi Watts), the wife of US senator Joe Wilson (Sean Penn), as a CIA undercover agent by the Bush Administration at breakneck speed. Plame's research based on her contacts in Iraq had put serious doubts on the existence of WMD in Iraq, which was not in line with White House's view point. They thus considered her \"fair game\" for discrediting and public exposure. Fair Game is fascinating for all those interested in the mechanism of power and use/abuse of it; and is also a riveting piece of film making. In my view it's Liman's best film to date.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Fair Game", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3772581401", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MzU2NTM3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc1NzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MzU2NTM3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc1NzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "CIA operative Valerie Plame (Watts), who is investigating the existence of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq, discovers her identity allegedly leaked by the government as payback for an op-ed article her husband (Penn) wrote criticizing the Bush administration.", "uploadDate": "2010-08-20T12:21:40Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0977855", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fair-Game", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fair-Game/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fair-Game/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fair-Game/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fair-Game/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-25"}
