The conviction of the boy would mean a death sentence and the destiny of the boy's life is in the hands of twelve male jurors of ranging personalities. The case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. For eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror, Mr. Davis (Henry Fonda), the boy's life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. As the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors.\n\nThe underlying issues are the complexity of the personalities of the jurors and the reasons why they have the motivation to feel and act the way they do. As the case unfolds further, more is learned about each juror individually. The personalities range from being a short-tempered loud mouth to a straight- laced accountant who never breaks a sweat. As the movie progresses much more is learned of the characters that exposes the intricacy of human nature and people's different personality traits.\n\n This film is an excellent example of movie making that does not require elaborate sets to entertain the viewer. The majority of the film takes place in a jury room with the men never leaving the room from their deliberation responsibilities. The cast and dialogue make this film memorable and the film has some clear moral issues that are addressed. The main issue is that not everything is as it seems. With further analysis the understanding of a situation becomes more concrete enabling the men to make a solid decision that affects a young man's life. 12 Angry Men is a classic film that should not be missed.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "12 Angry Men", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3452609817", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE3MWNhZDYtYjFlMS00MzM4LTg5M2YtYTAwMGY2ZDg0OGY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE3MWNhZDYtYjFlMS00MzM4LTg5M2YtYTAwMGY2ZDg0OGY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Three Reasons Criterion trailer", "uploadDate": "2012-08-23T03:04:12Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050083", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/12-Angry-Men", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/12-Angry-Men/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/12-Angry-Men/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/12-Angry-Men/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/12-Angry-Men/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
