Having been a fan of Issac Asimov for many years I thought that this adaptation with Chris Columbus at the helm would be terrible. I was wrong. Some may complain that this movie is too long and slow, but I would wager that their attention spans are somewhat lacking. If you are looking for a high action movie with robots then you have come to the wrong place. If you are looking for a sci-fi based romantic comedy about the personal growth of one man...er robot, then this is the movie. The comedy was well written and well played, appropriately placed in each moment. AS for the character of Andrew(Robin Williams), though he is supposed to be a robot you really connect with his character and sense his growth over time. Unlike A.I. his character learns and grows and has real not fabricated emotional attachments. I give this movie an 8 or 9. Very good.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H12M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Bicentennial Man", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi783941913", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmEyZjQ1MWEtZjA0My00MzU0LWI3NzctZDIzN2E4ODQwNzc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmEyZjQ1MWEtZjA0My00MzU0LWI3NzctZDIzN2E4ODQwNzc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Touchstone Pictures", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T12:33:26Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182789", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Bicentennial-Man", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Bicentennial-Man/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Bicentennial-Man/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Bicentennial-Man/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
