You can imagine what happens to him; pretty much everything you can think of.\n\nI wanted to like this movie, but it was too much of a clich\u00e9 for me. Nothing unexpected happened; the bad guys were all bad, the good guys were all good, the Lebanese immigrant didn't make a wrong step. If only life were like that.\n\nDespite everything bad happening to him, he rises above it all and is determined to live the American dream. Nothing gets him down.\n\nNevertheless, I did watch the whole thing which was rare for something I had never heard of before, and I enjoyed it. It was a feel-good movie, which I also enjoyed. Sometimes I, or anyone, needs some of that.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "U.S. Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi539796761", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MjU2MTIyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY1OTQzOA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MjU2MTIyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY1OTQzOA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A drama centered on Ibrahim, an Arab immigrant who wins the American green card lottery, arriving in New York City on September 10th, 2001.", "uploadDate": "2012-08-29T08:51:59Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1942989", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Citizen", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Citizen/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Citizen/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Citizen/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-11-13"}
