I was immediately drawn to it. It's suppose to come out April 14th but it came through with the Central Florida Film Festival two weeks early. I could have waited and paid less and got a better seat, but oh my god, even with a crap view I was blown away.\n\nThe cinematography was masterful, the acting was spectacular, the dialogue was a little awkward in pints but never really faltered, and the plot! You would think a movie consisting of 2 characters in a house would have it moments of tediousness, but not at all. So many psychological thrills it will set your mind a boggling.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Hard Candy", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2217190937", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY1MzVlYWUtOWNkZC00YjhiLThlZTItYjFlOGY0NWVmYmJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY1MzVlYWUtOWNkZC00YjhiLThlZTItYjFlOGY0NWVmYmJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Lionsgate", "uploadDate": "2013-05-04T04:15:05Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424136", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Hard-Candy", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Hard-Candy/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Hard-Candy/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Hard-Candy/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
