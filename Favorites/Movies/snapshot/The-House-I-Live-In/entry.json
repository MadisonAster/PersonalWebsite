This is a VERY powerful documentary that doesn't just paint a black and white picture telling us that drugs are acceptable or that drugs are bad, it talks about the HUNDREDS of elements which make up the complex drug and prison system we know of today. \n\nSome of the top minds in the industry on both sides give the best and most insightful talks, this has really been an eye opening film for me.\n\nI wish I could mass produce this DVD for free and mail it to every citizen of the US. We need to change this system, it's broken and heading down a very scary path. Most people think that drugs and prisons don't affect them so why bother with the issue, you couldn't be any more wrong. Thousands of times a day the authorities are searching people and seizing property without due process, many times never finding anything. A man was killed after a raid and nothing was found. This IS RELEVANT TO ALL CITIZENS OF America. The Constitution is our savings grace, don't let it burn to ash along with your freedom. \n\nPlease watch this, even if you don't agree with everything, I feel like you can still learn something and apply it to your community and the ballet box to make a positive change in the right direction.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4175930393", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNjUzMzI1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc3MTM0OA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNjUzMzI1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODc3MTM0OA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An investigative look at America's war on drugs and its impact on the criminal justice system, with a focus on the experiences of Nannie Jeter, a former employee of filmmaker Eugene Jarecki's family.", "uploadDate": "2012-09-05T09:07:20Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2125653", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-House-I-Live-In", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-House-I-Live-In/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-House-I-Live-In/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-House-I-Live-In/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-House-I-Live-In/thumb.jpg"}
