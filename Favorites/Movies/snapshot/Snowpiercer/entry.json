These are absolutely undeniable. The concept is far-fetched, the execution bizarre, and the upper class characters quite comical. The key to appreciating this film is understanding its purpose. Snowpiercer is clearly a social commentary, but going into it expecting a Hunger Games sort of dystopian social commentary, you are absolutely going to find it ridiculous.\n\nInstead, a much better genre match to this film would be Brazil. Its absurdity makes it even more horrifying. The fact that there is no true logic, the contrast between the dingy tail section and the bright colors and extravagance of the front, and the utter hopelessness of the plot make this movie, yes, bizarre to watch and difficult to relate to. However, the alienation of this world from ours brings out the social commentary and the cautionary tale within.\n\nAnother up-side was the diversity presented in the train and the framing of women WITHOUT the male gaze! All in all, I was pleasantly surprised by this film and my only real criticism is that it was way too long.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H6M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1214688537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5OTYwNjUxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc5MTAyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5OTYwNjUxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc5MTAyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In a future where a failed global-warming experiment kills off all life on the planet except for a lucky few that boarded the Snowpiercer, a train that travels around the globe, where a class system evolves.", "uploadDate": "2014-05-31T08:20:53Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706620", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Snowpiercer", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Snowpiercer/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Snowpiercer/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Snowpiercer/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-03-30"}
