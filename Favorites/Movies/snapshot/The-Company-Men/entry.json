Despite a few dumbed down bits, The Company Men, comes with a feeling of authenticity with some heart and decent performances from everybody. That is good enough for me.\n\nIn a hundred minutes, The Company Men gives us a small taste of what The recession did to American business. It does so in a way that favours character over making anti-corporate statements. The movie chooses to zoom in on the lives of three sales executives and how they deal with job loss.\n\nI've never been in love with Ben Affleck, but when he wants to, he can show some professionalism. In The Company Men he does just that, proving capable of hitting all the emotional notes when necessary, something I feel he missed in his previous film the Town.\n\nThe Company Men is actually a rather sad movie. It is only a hundred minute in length, but it feels longer. There is a good amount of talk, but nothing ever feels too contrived, wasted or unnecessary. Is it a brilliant film? No, but I can safely recommend it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Company Men: Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3740599833", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDIwNDg3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzc3Nzg4MjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDIwNDg3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzc3Nzg4MjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A year in the life of three men trying to survive a round of corporate downsizing at a major company - and how that affects them, their families, and their communities.", "uploadDate": "2010-07-28T09:50:39Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1172991", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Company-Men", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Company-Men/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Company-Men/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Company-Men/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
