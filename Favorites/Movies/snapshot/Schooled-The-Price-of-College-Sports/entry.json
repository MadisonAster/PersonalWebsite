So, it's not surprising that I would watch \"Schooled: The Price of College Sports\". But, I was even more eager to watch it because it attacks a problem that needs attention--and it's THE reason I hate college sports. And, it's the reason I strongly recommend you see this documentary. \n\nThe main idea behind this film is that universities (and particularly the head coaches) make billions because of their football teams. Yet, inexplicably, students often make nothing or next to nothing. Folks usually think that it's not a bad system-- after all, the student athletes do get a free education. BUT, the film abounds with example after example of students who really were taken advantage of by this system--a system with no real way to appeal. The most egregious is one case where a student was paralyzed on the football field--and who promptly lost his scholarship because the school made it contingent on his being able to play. What's worse---they also refused to pay for his medical bills. Does this sound fair? Well, in addition to this one, the film does a great job in pushing for student athletes to actually get paid--which is especially important as most of these folks (98.5%) never make it to pro ball.\n\nI could go on and on with all the reasonable examples they gave that the system should be changed, but the bottom line is that you should see the film yourself and see what you think. Even if it doesn't completely convince you, it will get you to think--and I love a well made documentary that makes you think.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H25M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1185785881", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzNDIwNjM3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcwNDcyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzNDIwNjM3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcwNDcyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A documentary that examines how college sports in America became a billion dollar enterprise built on the backs of its unpaid athletes.", "uploadDate": "2013-10-03T15:56:44Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3057718", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Schooled-The-Price-of-College-Sports", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Schooled-The-Price-of-College-Sports/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Schooled-The-Price-of-College-Sports/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Schooled-The-Price-of-College-Sports/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Schooled-The-Price-of-College-Sports/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-08-27"}
