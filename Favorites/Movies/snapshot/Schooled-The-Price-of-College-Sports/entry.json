The tutors are essential prostitutes. They don't attend class, but their names show up on the attendance sheets. They're treated like celebrities.\n\nThis is the dumbest movie I've EVER seen.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "1", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "A documentary that examines how college sports in America became a billion dollar enterprise built on the backs of its unpaid athletes.", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1185785881", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzNDIwNjM3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcwNDcyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzNDIwNjM3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcwNDcyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2013-10-03T15:56:44Z"}, "url": "/title/tt3057718/", "EntryAdded": "2015-08-27"}
