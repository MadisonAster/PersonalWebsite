The tempo and feeling of the movie were perfect, no over the top acting or unnecessary scenes. As someone stated earlier, the racial issues of the time were touched on perfectly but not focused on. Mos is a true renaissance man...he makes good music, plays bass guitar, does Broadway, as well as movies. He is slowly approaching superstar status, but is not chasing it as many do. I think this performance will certainly bring this talented performer the recognition he deserves. The sky is the limit for this guy.\n\nAs an African-American screenwriter, it dismays me to always see \"films\" like soul plane and the like represent black film today. There are so many stories to be told, history and themes to be explored. This film made me proud."}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386792", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Something-the-Lord-Made", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Something-the-Lord-Made/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Something-the-Lord-Made/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Something-the-Lord-Made/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-08-10"}
