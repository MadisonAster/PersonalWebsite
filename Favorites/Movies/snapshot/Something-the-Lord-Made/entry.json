This is definitely the case with \"Something the Lord Made.\" I can't wait to do a little reading up on this very intriguing story! Alan Rickman as Alfred Blalock is excellent, as he always is, but the real pleasure is in watching Mos Def as Vivien Thomas. Through his lovely, subtly nuanced performance, we are able to truly appreciate this incredibly gifted and complex man. The writers did an excellent job of making the viewer aware of the racial climate in Viven Thomas' life; note the early scene in which Vivien and a friend are walking and talking, and each time some white people approach them on the sidewalk, they step aside and yield right of way without hesitation. And yet, there is no heavy-handedness or preachy air to these scenes. The racial injustices that Vivien Thomas endured are obvious, but the viewer is not clubbed over the head with them."}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386792", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Something-the-Lord-Made", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Something-the-Lord-Made/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Something-the-Lord-Made/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Something-the-Lord-Made/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Something-the-Lord-Made/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-08-10"}
