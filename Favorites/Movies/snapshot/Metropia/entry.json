This is a dark age, where the automobile is no longer in use, replaced by a cross country subway system. The most popular product on the market (in fact pretty much the only item) is a shampoo manufactured with a secret mind controlling chemical, which the major corporations use to monitor the public in George Orwell fashion.\n\nIn an age where animation can do anything, the decision to do almost nothing certainly stands out in film. Metropia is without doubt the bleakest animated feature I know; a murky institutional world, without a drop of color or sunshine, and everywhere we go is under lit. This makes enough sense when taking into account that this is a future where society is low on energy. \n\nNot everything however feels credible. The absence of people in great numbers is unusual. The few people who do wander in and out of frame are almost hollow shells. They have no soul, but more importantly they have no movement. Metropia uses the least amount of energy possible to give life to illustrations. To attempt to describe it is not impossible, but it's something that is better off seen for ones self. Metropia is a haunting experience. It's almost a ghost world, not just from the absence of sight, but from the absence of sound. Metropia makes effective use of silence in all the right places, accompanied by an effective, very new age score. \n\nAs for the storyline, it is familiar, but not painfully so. It's similar to Brazil, which itself is the product of George Orwell's influence. The climax here feels a bit rushed, and easy, leaving Metropia a bit shorter than I think it should've been, but it remains an entertaining experiment.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H26M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Metropia", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3641640729", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAxNTUxZGUtMDlmYi00MDMwLTkyNDMtYWJkYjU2N2MzZjc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAxNTUxZGUtMDlmYi00MDMwLTkyNDMtYWJkYjU2N2MzZjc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Visually stunning trailer for this thriller", "uploadDate": "2010-05-18T15:34:56Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0985058", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Metropia", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Metropia/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Metropia/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Metropia/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Metropia/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-06-15"}
