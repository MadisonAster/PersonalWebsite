It's taken me 20 years to finally watch it, and though film-making has advanced technologically in terms of CGI in that time - it still looks stunning ! It's a slow burning story and there's not much joy and laughs - but the sense of love and family and resoluteness still lingered way after the film ended. It's concept of Heaven and Hell is way beyond conventional film directors. It's a labour of love which at the end is faith affirming and yet shows up all our human flaws and vulnerability in all their glory. Great direction - good acting and an incredible journey that will stay in your mind .", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "What Dreams May Come", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4110156057", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTg1NjAyMGItMDBhYS00MmIxLWI3MGYtMzNjZWE2ZDgyYzJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTg1NjAyMGItMDBhYS00MmIxLWI3MGYtMzNjZWE2ZDgyYzJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:22:20Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120889", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Dreams-May-Come", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Dreams-May-Come/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Dreams-May-Come/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Dreams-May-Come/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
