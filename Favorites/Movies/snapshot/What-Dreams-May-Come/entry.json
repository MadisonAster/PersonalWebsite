I bought the DVD just a few days ago and watched it again tonight and I cried so much. It is an amazing movie that really has you on your seat wondering what will happen next. It is neat to see the possible reality of one's \"after-life\" in heaven or hell. It makes you want to love those whom you love more and more every day and make sure that they know it. I was watching it tonight with my fianc\u00e9 and could not keep the tears from coming....even after the movie I was crying because I was thinking about how I would feel if I lost him. I am not one to cry much, especially when I'm watching a movie. But this movie was a definite tear-jerker and an excellent must-see film! :o)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "What Dreams May Come", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4110156057", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTg1NjAyMGItMDBhYS00MmIxLWI3MGYtMzNjZWE2ZDgyYzJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTg1NjAyMGItMDBhYS00MmIxLWI3MGYtMzNjZWE2ZDgyYzJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:22:20Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120889", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Dreams-May-Come", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Dreams-May-Come/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Dreams-May-Come/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Dreams-May-Come/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Dreams-May-Come/thumb.jpg"}
