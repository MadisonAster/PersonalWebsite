Ir made me think about what his heaven would be like, if he was watching his family grieve and I hope he's found peace. This film hits home for a lot of us, obviously because Robin killed himself. I don't believe people who commit suicide out of sadness or loss of hope go to hell, I believe they go to heaven like everyone else - Maybe that's just me being idealistic. As a film though, this moved me a lot. It was quite a sad film but at the same time there were moments of joy and sweetness. The acting was superb. I've never seen Robin act in this kind of role and I think it brought out his gentle, loving side people who knew him often spoke about. He spoke with this fascinating softness that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside.I feel he should be more well know for this role because its a great film. Annabella was also brilliant , she really brought out the raw emotion and pain a widow goes through after not only losing her children but then her husband. Although Cuba played a small part in this, his was also a great piece of acting (I wouldn't expect anything less from him). I cried a lot through this film, all for various reasons including the death of Robin and that pain of seeing him being wonderful and I am really going to miss him, also the film was very moving and does make you think, it also made me think of my life and what I'd do if certain people tragically left my life. So it hit home on quite a few levels. For its time the CG is actually pretty good, I've seen worse CG in films nowadays. Anyway, a fantastic film and anyone wishing to see a moving performance by Robin should watch this, he's incredible and always will be. I hope he's in his own private heaven at peace right now.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "What Dreams May Come", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4110156057", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTg1NjAyMGItMDBhYS00MmIxLWI3MGYtMzNjZWE2ZDgyYzJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTg1NjAyMGItMDBhYS00MmIxLWI3MGYtMzNjZWE2ZDgyYzJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:22:20Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120889", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Dreams-May-Come", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Dreams-May-Come/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Dreams-May-Come/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Dreams-May-Come/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Dreams-May-Come/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
