There was massive explosions that could be heard thousands of miles away, tsunamis and a huge cloud of ash from the final explosion.\n\nThe lighthouse featured in this gets destroyed by a huge tidal wave and we see how a ship copes on the rough seas. Luckily, all survive.\n\nThe special effects in this are fantastic, especially the scenes where Krakatoa is erupting.\n\nWell done to the BBC for bringing us this. \n\nFor another version of this disaster, I recommend 1969's Krakatoa, East of Java with Maximilian Schell and Diane Baker.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H27M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0791318", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Krakatoa-The-Last-Days", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Krakatoa-The-Last-Days/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Krakatoa-The-Last-Days/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Krakatoa-The-Last-Days/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Krakatoa-The-Last-Days/thumb.jpg"}
