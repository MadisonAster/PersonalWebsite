The eruption and its effects (including tsunamis and a super-hot ash cloud) took over 36,000 lives. The story follows several characters throughout the ordeal, including a Dutch official, his family, and his native clerk; a ship captain, his passengers and crew; a lighthouse keeper and his family; and a Dutch scientist in Indonesia to study the regions volcanoes. Included are narrations from diaries and journals of the survivors. The special effects are pretty good for a film of its kind, and unlike most made-for-TV fare, this docudrama actually has some good acting.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H27M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0791318", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Krakatoa-The-Last-Days", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Krakatoa-The-Last-Days/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Krakatoa-The-Last-Days/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Krakatoa-The-Last-Days/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Krakatoa-The-Last-Days/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-08-22"}
