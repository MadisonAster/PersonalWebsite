Trillian and Arthur end up in a love story, Zaphod's turned into a prick, the plot is changed a bit, and the inclusion of slapstick humour. Even some new characters where made by DNA for the movie. \n\nYou need to remember that H2G2 in every version has contradicted itself. Each form is a different entity, so this movie should be regarded in that sense. I can see what they did.---\n\nI personally don't like the movie much. I am a dyed in the wool fan of the books. To be fair, there are some things I do like in this. I think Zoe was exceptional as Trillian. I thought some of the visuals of the movie were brilliant. It is these parts, and the 20year slog, that gets me to a 4/10\n\nThere were moments of greatness, and it's in that that I am most upset. The greatness shows what COULD have been. A H2G2 movie could have been brilliant, but with the changes to the source; for fans of the original, it's average.\n\nThe movie I feel was tailored to a new audience. The humour feels closer to American humour than British. I'm not sure if this was intended or not. The changes where made to make it a stand alone 2hr movie with enough 'normal points' to keep non-fans happy. I don't know if it worked. I don't know if new audiences, that had never read the books (or played the game, listened to the radio, or watched the TV series), will enjoy the humour.\n\nWhat really worries me is that people will see the movie, think it's terrible and than write off every other format. That would be the ultimate disgrace to DNA.\n\nFans will find this from average to terrible. Everyone else I only pray they seek the source.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1099150873", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NDczOTg3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkzMTIyMDI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NDczOTg3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkzMTIyMDI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005)", "uploadDate": "2016-10-04T05:19:38Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Hitchhikers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Hitchhikers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Hitchhikers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Hitchhikers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Hitchhikers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy/thumb.jpg"}
