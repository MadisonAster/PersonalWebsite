I don't want to sit in the cinema watching a line by line copy of the radio play, book, or TV series. Each of those stand by their own merit, and each were good largely because of the new material they contained.\n\nI think the cast did an excellent job, and although Zaphod wasn't quite how I pictured him, Sam Rockwell brought a freshness to the part which largely works. His portrayal of Zaphod as a guy who \"thinks he is cool\", rather than \"is cool\" works pretty well, and once you get over the southern drawl, he soon settles as a character. Ford is beautifully played, as are all the major characters.\n\nAdmittedly, some of the criticisms that were voiced by Simpson have some justification, but most were simply overstated to support his general vitriolic attack on the \"purity\" of the film.\n\nIn summary, go to see this film and don't worry.\n\nI'm looking forward to the DVD and I have all my fingers crossed for a sequel.\n\nMartin", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1099150873", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NDczOTg3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkzMTIyMDI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NDczOTg3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkzMTIyMDI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005)", "uploadDate": "2016-10-04T05:19:38Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Hitchhikers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Hitchhikers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Hitchhikers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Hitchhikers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Hitchhikers-Guide-to-the-Galaxy/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-06-07"}
