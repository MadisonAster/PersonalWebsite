But as \"Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room\" shows, it shouldn't have been. The documentary, narrated by Peter Coyote, traces the energy giant's origins - including CEO Ken Lay's childhood - to its rise as one of the largest corporations in the United States.\n\nWhat's really interesting is the intricacy of Enron's actions around the world, and how it pulled off all its shenanigans (aided, of course, by Kenny Boy's contributions to George W. Bush's first presidential campaign). Among Enron's more vicious acts was its manipulation of California's electricity in summer, 2001, and how Arnold Schwarzenegger let the company off the hook. Not to mention that Enron's collapse was accompanied by Lay's draining of the employees' retirement.\n\nEnron's downfall - followed over the next year by the implosions of Adelphia, WorldCom and Tyco - just goes to show the dangers of letting corporations run rampant. The whole way through, the documentary manages to be funny, just at the sight of what Enron was doing, abetted by Arthur Andersen.\n\nAll in all, I definitely recommend \"E:TSGITR\".\n\nPS: In \"Bowling for Columbine\", Michael Moore proposed a TV show called \"Corporate Cops\" (based on \"Cops!\"), in which people like Ken Lay would get strip-searched.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1016268", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Enron-The-Smartest-Guys-in-the-Room", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Enron-The-Smartest-Guys-in-the-Room/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Enron-The-Smartest-Guys-in-the-Room/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Enron-The-Smartest-Guys-in-the-Room/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2016-09-14"}
