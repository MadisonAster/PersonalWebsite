                          'mark-to-market accounting it saw the start of the '
                          'dramatic increase in its profits and its share '
                          'price. The method allows a company to claim '
                          'projected earnings from projects once the deal is '
                          'signed. With this in place Enron was able to earn '
                          'money without actually earning money. However this '
                          'could not go on forever and the company was under '
                          'pressure to continually come up with new ideas to '
                          'keep the deals and money flowing. And it did so, to '
                          'the point where it was widely praised within the '
                          'business community and by stockholders. However '
                          'things would eventually catch up with the company '
                          'and a few years ago the company collapsed in '
                          'bankruptcy before the arrests began.\n'
                          '\n'
                          'Working for an American multinational myself I am '
                          'always interested and critical of the business '
                          'model of making more and more money and keeping the '
                          'stock increasing in value being the only way to '
                          'survive. So I have watched films like this and like '
                          'The Corporation with interest and appreciate the '
                          'way that they sell a complex issue in easy to '
                          'understand ways. With the Enron film it is all the '
                          'more interesting because it is a prime example of '
                          'how it all fell down and how easy it is to con the '
                          'market \x96 which, regardless of the legality of '
                          'the accounting method used, is basically what they '
                          'did! The film tells the story well and it is a tale '
                          'that never struggles to fascinate. Lesser hands '
                          'could have fudged the telling but the team here '
                          'structure it well and use footage from Enron and '
                          'C-Span to really good effect. In fact I did wonder '
                          'how much this film cost to make because the vast '
                          'majority of it is stock footage and a handful of '

                          'which is a shame because the story is compelling '
                          'enough and damning enough to work without resorting '
                          'to cheap digs, funny footage and so on. Sadly it '
                          'does use this \x96 not to the point of distraction '
                          'but just to the point where I wondered if the '
                          "makers didn't think that the facts would be strong "
                          'enough to make the audience get the point without '
                          'the extra bit of hammering. The film also stretches '
                          'to bring in Bush and his cronies as if they were '
                          "also to blame; it doesn't labour this point but "
                          'what little it does is stretched \x96 again it '
                          'could have done less and allowed the audience to '
                          'draw its own conclusions.\n'

                          'it is a bit biased and based on commentary from '
                          'subjects all on one side of the fence. However it '
                          'is well structured and easy to follow, stripping '
                          'away the feared complexity of the tale and telling '
                          'it in a fascinating and engaging way. A cautionary '
                          'tale that I doubt that those that needed to learn '
