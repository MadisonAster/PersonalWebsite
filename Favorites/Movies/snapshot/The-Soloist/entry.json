A caring Los Angeles reporter named Steve Lopez (Robert Downey, Jr.) tries to help a homeless man named Nathaniel Anthony Ayers (Jamie Foxx).\n\nAyers suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. But he once attended Julliard, and he still lives and breathes the music of Beethoven. Ayers, with his shopping cart of possessions, walks the streets, playing his violin amid the noise of the freeway. He's content, in his own world.\n\nThat unusual behavior grabs the attention of Lopez, no doubt as a human interest story for his own column. But as Lopez gradually becomes more genuinely concerned about Ayers, their relationship encounters frustration, anger, and emotional pain.\n\nIt's a poignant, gritty story, full of realism. The film manages to be compassionate without being patronizing. The film does a terrific job in portraying the harsh, depressing reality of the boarders who live at a large shelter where Ayers goes, at the insistence of Lopez. \n\nTechnical elements of the film are good. The visuals are thematically impressive. Production design and costumes are detailed and realistic. Acting is credible. Robert Downey, Jr. gives a fine performance.\n\nThe main problem is the plot. Too much time is spent on Lopez and his trivialities. Somehow, the compelling Ayers story morphs into a weighty examination of Lopez and his distress in dealing with Ayers. The script is to blame here. I think if the main character had been Ayers, instead of Lopez, the film could have been quite inspiring.\n\nEven so, the film clearly calls attention to the plight of the urban homeless. As such, the film deserves viewer support.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "This is the theatrical trailer for The Soloist, directed by Joe Wright and starring Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr.", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3497984025", "name": "The Soloist: Trailer", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjE3MzA1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg4MTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjE3MzA1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg4MTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2008-10-16T12:52:44Z"}, "url": "/title/tt0821642/", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
