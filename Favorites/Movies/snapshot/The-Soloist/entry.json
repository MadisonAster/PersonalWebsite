It's been a few months since I'd been moved by the trailer. However, the film never came out. I thought it might have been shelved.\n\nI was glad to see it was indeed playing. In spite of the reviews, I persevered on the strength of the trailer. It seemed to me there was too much talent and pedigree involved for it to actually suck. And you know what? it's a terrific film with a poignant story. Perhaps lower expectations propped up my perceptions of it, however, it still stands as time well spent.\n\nThe film is based on a true story involving a top columnist at the LA Times, Steve Lopez, played with grace by Robert Downey Jr., who becomes invested in one of his more colourful subjects, Nathaniel Ayers, an accomplished musician overcome by mental illness, now living on the streets of LA portrayed by Jamie Foxx, who rambles his way to a convincing performance.\n\nThe film is a satisfying adult drama that doesn't lose it's direction. It doesn't pander to it's audience. There is no random violence, no guns, but indeed simply good story telling with great characterizations. It's a decent film that deserves better treatment in the press. It has a noble heart that succeeds in telling a great human story.\n\nIt resonates and strikes a chord.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Soloist: Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3497984025", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjE3MzA1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg4MTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjE3MzA1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg4MTMyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "This is the theatrical trailer for The Soloist, directed by Joe Wright and starring Jamie Foxx and Robert Downey Jr.", "uploadDate": "2008-10-16T12:52:44Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0821642", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Soloist", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Soloist/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Soloist/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Soloist/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
