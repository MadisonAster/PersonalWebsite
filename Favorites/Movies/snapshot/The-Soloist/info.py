                          'Glass, Darkly", the 2009 film "The Soloist" is one '
                          'of the two most accurate portrayals of '
                          'schizophrenia, from the point of view of the '
                          'mentally ill person and of people who want to '
                          'interact with the ill person. I speak from '
                          'experience. David Cronenberg\'s film, "Spider", is '
                          'the other. \n'
                          '\n'
                          'I was disappointed in my two favourite critics, '
                          'James Berardinelli and Roger Ebert, each of who '
                          'gave "The Soloist" only 62Â½%. \n'
                          '\n'
                          'Berardinelli says, "The Soloist is afflicted with a '
                          'lack of passion. The story lacks a strong '
                          'trajectory; it meanders, seemingly unsure of '
                          'precisely what it wants to do and say and where it '
                          'wants to go." Actually, that is the reality of '
                          'schizophrenia. One never knows what is going to '
                          'happen next. There are many setbacks. He also says, '
                          '"The soundtrack supplies multiple, overlapping '
                          'voices. The objective is to invite the viewer to '
                          "participate in the unhinging of Nathaniel's mind, a "
                          'first-person perspective of schizophrenia. '
                          'Unfortunately, it feels artificial and contrived." '

                          'tasks while being bombarded by random voices from '
                          'behind. Many class members find that to be the most '

                          'medicated until they become sane? The film '
