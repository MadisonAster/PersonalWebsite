It can definitely be considered an \"intelligent\" thriller.  And I think that Matt Damon made a good choice choosing this role.  He gets to explore the darker side of a character, a change for him, and he does so very well!  On the outside he appears so wholesome and harmless but if you watch his eyes, they can give you a chill. And I must say that Jude Law, an actor I had not seen much of before I saw this film, also gave a great performance.  He has great charm and you can almost understand why \"Mr. Ripley\" would go to such great lengths to possess his life. Damon did a good job of conveying how desperate he was to be someone with a life worth coveting.  Don't be put off by how long it is, it is worth the watch.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H19M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134119", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Talented-Mr-Ripley", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Talented-Mr-Ripley/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Talented-Mr-Ripley/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Talented-Mr-Ripley/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Talented-Mr-Ripley/thumb.jpg"}
