During those thirty minutes you realize that Stone and his team of writers were searching desperately for a way to end the movie on a positive, hopeful note. We are left to plod along with them on this implausible track. Also, during the ending Gekko's daughter's character consistency is shot to hell and she appears as venal as the characters against whom she rails.\n\nThose moments are especially disappointing because I believed that this movie had the potential to be Stone's best film ever. Carey Mulligan and Michael Douglas in particular delivered great performances. Shia Lebeouf is \"good enough.\" The writing is fairly unpredictable then everything seems to be tied into a nice bundle near the end. The problem was that Stone couldn't quite bring himself to put the bow on that bundle. He wanted to add a bit of glitter to it, which seemed gaudy and completely out of place.\n\nBottom line: if this movie had ended on a somewhat dark note it would have reflected the reality of modern day Wall Street, and it would have made for a tighter, better movie.\n\nIt's worth watching, and if you liked the first Wall Street it probably won't disappoint you. You might want to leave during its third act, though :)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H13M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi875627545", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTYwOTYwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTkxNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTYwOTYwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTkxNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Emerging from a lengthy prison stint, Gordon Gekko finds himself on the outside of a world he once dominated.
