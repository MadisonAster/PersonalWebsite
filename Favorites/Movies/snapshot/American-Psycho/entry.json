It is a depiction, a fantasy if you will, of the life of modern man and his place in society.\n\nNothing is enough. Money, sex, social stature, there is always someone else who has more and everyone else expect from you to try harder for even more.\n\nThis movie is about eliminating competition the easy way. By killing your opponents. By eating your sexual partners. By destroying everyone around you.\n\n'American Psycho' retains the balance between this psychotic state, a chilling thriller and a very funny movie.\n\nThe scenes that show Patrick playing music for his guests are absolutely hilarious, as he comments very seriously on records by artists such as Whitney Houston, Phil Collins and Huey Lewis & the News. The funny thing is that he chooses the most commercial or sold out records of these artists, to explain how much better they are compared to their previous, more artistic work. Another message of the state of the receivers of commercial art.\n\nYou can analyze 'American Psycho' for hours. It can be perceived both as a deep and a fun movie. Even if you don't like the story, you will love Christian Bale's excellent performance.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n10/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "text os", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4060743449", "name": "American Psycho", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFiZmIwOTUtMmVkNy00YmZkLWE4ODAtYjE4NWUwNzNiZDM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzFiZmIwOTUtMmVkNy00YmZkLWE4ODAtYjE4NWUwNzNiZDM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2010-05-18T14:52:19Z"}, "url": "/title/tt0144084/"}
