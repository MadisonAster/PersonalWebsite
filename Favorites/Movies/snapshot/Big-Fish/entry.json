When I was a kid, I never could explain what he was doing. I got it a month before his death when i was 26. This film filled my eyes with tears, because it reminded me him. he had a lot of ideas and brilliant and original ideas for improving the world, but for all his life he could not sell it to anyone, because those ideas filled his whole day. Literally. His whole apartment was filled with papers. Thank you for this movie. Thank you for the message. I would add a note that when we dream, we are escaping from the world of facts and truths. When my father said that if you think of anything in life, you have to write it down because what comes to your mind it never comes again it changed my life. Now I'm writing a book - a novel from environment of Mesopotamia and that just because my father was someone who believed in imagination and creative values\u200b\u200b.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H5M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1493149209", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A son tries to learn more about his dying father by reliving stories and myths he told about his life.", "uploadDate": "2013-04-03T14:49:06Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319061", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Big-Fish", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Big-Fish/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Big-Fish/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Big-Fish/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-03-12"}
