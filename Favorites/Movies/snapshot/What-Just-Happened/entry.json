However, like the film within the film, What Just Happened? feels too long. As a filmmaker myself, I really enjoyed this film, but I am afraid that much of the appeal will be missing in a general audience. A producer trying to change Bruce Willis' mind is pretty funny, but how funny is it to a non-producer or a non-Bruce-Willis? The performances, are, of course, outstanding. The entire cast is composed of nearly uncriticizable actors who are superb in any role they attempt. If you have an interest in how films come to be, this is a fun little flick. If you don't care about the behind-the-scenes, you may want to sit this one out.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "What Just Happened?: Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3015835929", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4OTk1MTMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc5MjczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4OTk1MTMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc5MjczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "This is the trailer for What Just Happened?, directed by Barry Levinson.", "uploadDate": "2008-08-05T17:39:18Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486674", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Just-Happened", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Just-Happened/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Just-Happened/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Just-Happened/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Just-Happened/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
