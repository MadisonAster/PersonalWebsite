The clock is ticking on both, and it's astounding just how little we care. Oh, and yes, that actually is the entire story. It certainly isn't enough for a feature. Maybe this should have been a TV pilot? There are several subplots, one more unresolved and utterly pointless than the next. I haven't read the memoirs that this is based upon. The acting is good, with the possible exception of Tucci(not sure what happened there). We've got real talent, but they can't reanimate the dead material they're given. There is barely anything funny in this at all. The handful of jokes are drawn out endlessly. Granted, Robert talking with Robin and \"trying to be understanding\" is amusing, and this can make you smile every now and then. On the whole, the punchline is that Hollywood is full of sex with underage girls, drugs and personal problems. Newsflash: We know. And it isn't delivered in any kind of fresh way. Maybe part of the issue is that these are in-jokes... we don't get them. This has been called indulgent and arrogant, and I completely agree. Why make a big flick that won't appeal to anyone not in the business? This is slow-paced and incredibly boring. It's too bad, because the editing and cinematography(with some hand-held camera) aren't bad. This is meant to be a satire... I'd go for S1m0ne over it any day. It's the worst I've seen by Levinson. There is a bunch of strong language, a bit of moderate, bloody violence and disturbing content and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with a trailer. I recommend this only to the most forgiving of potential viewers. 5/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "What Just Happened?: Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3015835929", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4OTk1MTMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc5MjczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4OTk1MTMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc5MjczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "This is the trailer for What Just Happened?, directed by Barry Levinson.", "uploadDate": "2008-08-05T17:39:18Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0486674", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Just-Happened", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Just-Happened/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Just-Happened/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/What-Just-Happened/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
