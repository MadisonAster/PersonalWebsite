More than this, however, it is a story about the strange life of being a knuckleball pitcher, and goes into some depth, about the history and interesting personalities of knuckleballers over the years.\n\nKnuckleball! is a movie that seems like it should be boring, but it is actually a wonderful human story of following a dream and finding improbable success. Knuckleballers, as the movie explains, are people borne of desperation--they see the end of their careers before them and conclude that, rather than quitting, they have to do something. They find their solution through a practice that at once gains them acceptance but also turns them into something of an outcast. We root for them because we appreciate people who can carve an unconventional path, and in watching them we feel like maybe we imperfect people have a chance also to make it in this world.\n\nAs a result, this movie is weirdly profound. For all of you who find the alternate path, this movie is for you. Watch it and cheer on the everyman, as he floats it up to the plate at 60 miles per hour and watches the world's most intimidating sluggers go up in smoke.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3385304345", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5MDUyMjAwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTczNTAzOA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5MDUyMjAwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTczNTAzOA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A documentary that showcases baseball's most unpredictable pitch.", "uploadDate": "2012-08-21T15:35:51Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2343601", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Knuckleball", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Knuckleball/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Knuckleball/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Knuckleball/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Knuckleball/thumb.jpg"}
