I never thought of this as one of them.\n\nI have seen Ben Affleck in a number of films, and felt that he was good in a few, OK in most, and positively annoying in some.\n\nI saw the horrible, misleading trailers.\n\nThe soundtrack was simply bad.\n\nSo, needless to say, I went into Paycheck with very low expectations.... and I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nAffleck plays a talented reverse-engineer, who sees the possibilities in new technology, and is able to carry it through to fruition. He takes on top-secret jobs and has his memory erased upon the completion of each. He decides to take on a project big and profitable enough to allow him to retire comfortably for the rest of his life. He completes the project, goes through the memory erasure, and then starts to discover what he has done, and, pursued by corporate hit men and the police, tries to recover his memory. Uma Thurmond, a biologist he had fallen in love with, is one of the memories he wants to recover, and also a target. \n\nPaycheck is more of an action film than a sci fi flick. The plot serves the action, as do the somewhat one-dimensional characters. And there is so little chemistry between Affleck and Thurmond that the romantic subplot is almost just a distraction. Despite these flaws, I spent an evening being thoroughly entertained by this rehashing of the usual technology-run-amok / knowledge-is-power story. This film is very Hollywood, and uses a lot of slick and clich\u00e9d camera-work, but nevertheless tells a good story and does it well enough.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Paycheck", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3399155993", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWEwOWEzZDctM2M5NC00YTcwLTg1MjYtYzMwMjc4N2E5NGJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWEwOWEzZDctM2M5NC00YTcwLTg1MjYtYzMwMjc4N2E5NGJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:22:36Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338337", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Paycheck", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Paycheck/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Paycheck/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Paycheck/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Paycheck/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
