You can tell how this is expanded from a story where the hero had five items/clues and now he has 20.  \n\nBen Affleck is a bland Ken Doll of a hero, though Uma Furman has almost as much spunk as she did in \"Kill Bill, Volume 1.\"  \n\nAs a John Woo movie, of course the chase scenes are the best part.  But the fight scenes are simply perplexing -- uh, why does Affleck's work out consist of electronic samurai stick fighting such that when the poorly-aiming bad guys all come at him with guns Uma throws him a stick to pick them off? \n\nWhile I did see the movie on a scratchy print with tinny sound, I don't think that explained the confusingly bad continuity in the hair and make-up such that I thought they had been time-traveling at some tropical vacation in between scenes."}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Paycheck", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3399155993", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWEwOWEzZDctM2M5NC00YTcwLTg1MjYtYzMwMjc4N2E5NGJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWEwOWEzZDctM2M5NC00YTcwLTg1MjYtYzMwMjc4N2E5NGJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:22:36Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338337", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Paycheck", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Paycheck/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Paycheck/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Paycheck/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Paycheck/thumb.jpg"}
