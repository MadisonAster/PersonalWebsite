This was almost unwatchable.\n\nThe jokes simply aren't funny, at all. Some of the jokes fail to even have a setup and/or punch line. The writing is lazy, not mixing in any creative humor and giving audiences exactly what they think is going to happen. This is also supposedly in the adult category as well. Involving several scenarios entitled Sex with ____, something that is clearly not supposed to be for kids, yet only they would find remotely funny. It's hard to say things simply aren't funny, but this is one of the few instances where I feel completely comfortable saying it. \n\nThis was an abomination. Not even so bad it's good either, just so bad it's unwatchable.
