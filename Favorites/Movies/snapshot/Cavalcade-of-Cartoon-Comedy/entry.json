Before The Cleveland Show, he made an entire 50-episode web series based on cutaway gags removed from Family Guy. Despite having the same professional TV animation budget as Family Guy, it does not have to abide by any network standards and it can have as many curse words as they want.\n\nI think most of this is okay if you're old enough to enjoy it. Some are funny, but there are also some disturbing shorts with blood, deaths, and there are also 2 shorts with poop and 2 shorts with nudity. It really depends on what sense of humor you have, but there are also a few shorts that are too cruel for most people to find them funny. My most favorite episodes were the Scotsman yelling at stupid movie characters, the gay knight, the glass house, Barry Gibb singing on the roller coaster, and 10 things you never hear, like \"Stressed Eric is a comedic masterpiece!\" That's just 1 I thought up myself. It wasn't 1 of those things they said.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Seth Macfarlane's Cavalcade Of Cartoon Comedy", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2862529561", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUyYzRjMDMtZDA2NS00ZTMyLTgwOTQtYWNhMjBkNmVhNGM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUyYzRjMDMtZDA2NS00ZTMyLTgwOTQtYWNhMjBkNmVhNGM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Seth Macfarlane's Cavalcade Of Cartoon Comedy", "uploadDate": "2019-04-22T20:37:53Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1295036", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Cavalcade-of-Cartoon-Comedy", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Cavalcade-of-Cartoon-Comedy/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Cavalcade-of-Cartoon-Comedy/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Cavalcade-of-Cartoon-Comedy/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
