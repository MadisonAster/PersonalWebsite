The most famous and popular of all was The Matrix but Alex Proyas's much more thought-provoking(which is saying something as the Matrix, at least the first movie was very thought provoking itself) film is just as good. No movie can ever have too much atmosphere, and Dark City exudes it from every frame of celluloid. Alex Proyas' world isn't just a playground for his characters to romp in -- it's an ominous place where viewers can get lost. We don't just coolly observe the bizarre, ever-changing skyline; we plunge into the city's benighted depths, following the protagonist as he explores the secrets of this grim place where the sun never shines. Visually, this film isn't just impressive, it's a tour de force. Thankfully, Dark City doesn't have an \"all style, no substance\" problem, either, because there's a mind-challenging story to go along with the eye candy. Proyas hasn't written this film for the passive viewer. To become involved in Dark City, thinking is mandatory."}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Dark City", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2614494745", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE0NThjNjktOWFjMy00N2YxLWJlOWEtMDlkOWFiMjAyMzY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE0NThjNjktOWFjMy00N2YxLWJlOWEtMDlkOWFiMjAyMzY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Dark City", "uploadDate": "2010-08-17T03:12:21Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dark-City", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dark-City/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dark-City/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dark-City/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dark-City/thumb.jpg"}
