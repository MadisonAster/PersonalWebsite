He uses the Gothic and claustrophobic themes commonly and dark colors prevail during the film like \"The Crow\" .The story doesn't follow a certain order of rule, instead there is some mind games and puzzles in the film, that causes watchers to be active in each minute and motivate to the movie..\n\nThe topic is about a man who loses his past and first finds himself in a bath tub, doesn^t know about himself and his life, but he has one ability that no one has, he can be alive when the evil forces stops the time and reshapes the world according to their own demand. The story is so fantastic and Proyas' nightmare world come true in that movie.\n\nI can basically say that it's one of the best science fiction movies ever made, it opens doors to different dimensions and force human brains' capability....\n\n\"Mutlu Bahar\"", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Dark City", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2614494745", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE0NThjNjktOWFjMy00N2YxLWJlOWEtMDlkOWFiMjAyMzY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE0NThjNjktOWFjMy00N2YxLWJlOWEtMDlkOWFiMjAyMzY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Dark City", "uploadDate": "2010-08-17T03:12:21Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118929", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dark-City", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dark-City/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dark-City/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dark-City/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
