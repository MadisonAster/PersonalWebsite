Tom Hardy, who I've noticed cropping up more and more in recent years, gives a tour-de-force performance as a psychotic inmate and man to whom violence is a way of life. His eerie voice, hulking frame and dead eyes all combine perfectly to make him one of cinema's most memorable villains in recent years, and with most of the scenes consisting of him speaking monologues in solitary cells, the film belongs to him.\n\nWhich is good, because the story isn't up to much. It's a loose dramatisation of the life of Michael Peterson, a man who robbed a post office and ended up becoming Charles Bronson, one of the most famous convicts of all time. To be honest, the events aren't all that interesting, and in other hands the continuous brawls with prison officers could become repetitive. Thank Heaven then for the presence of Nicolas Winding Refn (VALHALLA RISING) as director. This is a guy who understands cinema and the beauty of cinema, and he makes the film intensely watchable as a result. BRONSON looks a thing of beauty, even if that beauty is stark, brutal and minimalistic.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "A biopic of notorious British criminal Charles Bronson.", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1194066457", "name": "Bronson", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MzY2MjY1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkyODkxMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3MzY2MjY1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkyODkxMzE@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2009-08-25T07:27:25Z"}, "url": "/title/tt1172570/"}
