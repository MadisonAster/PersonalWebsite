Having seen the previews I thought nothing of ever seeing the film, but saw it on the shelf in the video store and thought it would pass an evening.\n\nIt did that very well, and is worth seeing for at least one reason. Although Robert Redford puts in a solid performance, James Gandolfini steals this movie with his simpering, bully-boy performance. Despite knowing from the opening scene that he will undoubted lose against Redford's disgraced general, Gandolfini's depiction of a man in authority but with little power is very subtle and worth watching.\n\nThe rest of the film has some clever moments, but you see everything coming - Redford inspiring the other prisoners, the inevitable conflicts and the finale.  The Last Castle is worth seeing once.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT2H11M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Last Castle", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2525954329", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI0NGI4YjItN2IzZC00NTk1LTlkZmUtMjNjYjk4ZDc3NTI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI0NGI4YjItN2IzZC00NTk1LTlkZmUtMjNjYjk4ZDc3NTI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Dreamworks", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:32:55Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272020", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Last-Castle", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Last-Castle/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Last-Castle/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Last-Castle/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Last-Castle/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-22"}
