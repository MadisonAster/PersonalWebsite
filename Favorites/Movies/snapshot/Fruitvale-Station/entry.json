Michael B. Jordan plays Oscar Grant III, an African-American man who was shot to death in the Fruitvale BART station on January 1st, 2009. The man who killed him was a police officer. The killer was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and served about two years in jail.\n\nThe film follows Grant through his last day of life--December 31st, 2008. We watch as Grant interacts with his common-law wife, their young daughter, friends, relatives and strangers. Grant comes across as a basically decent man--flawed, undependable, but clearly in love with his family, his partner. and their little girl. \n\nIt's hard to enjoy this film, because it's based on a truly tragic event, and we know how the story will end from the beginning of the movie. Still, Fruitvale Station is definitely worth seeing, because it reminds us that everyone's life is always at risk, but that the risks for young, African-American men are higher.\n\nThe movie will work well on DVD. It's definitely worth seeking out and seeing.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H25M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "New Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1457760537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMzQxMDQyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkxNTE5OQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMzQxMDQyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkxNTE5OQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The true story of Oscar, a 22-year-old Bay Area resident, who crosses paths with friends, enemies, family, and strangers on the last day of 2008.", "uploadDate": "2013-07-23T08:31:45Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2334649", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fruitvale-Station", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fruitvale-Station/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fruitvale-Station/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fruitvale-Station/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-12-17"}
