Those of us who were close to the events of 2008 will find something personal in the story-telling. Others may see it as more examples of greed and hubris. In any case, the following observations apply to both groups.\n\nThe performances are top notch. Everyone from Zachary Quinto to Demi Moore brings their A-game. Even supporting characters are oddly fleshed out for a film with such an ensemble cast. Kevin Spacey and Paul Bettany give the performances of their careers, I think. Only the Jeremy Irons character (John Tuld, aka Dick Fuld) feels a bit over the top, while the rest are truly believable well-rounded depictions.\n\nDespite having good characters and amazing cinematography, the film lacks plot. The backdrop and setting are tense, but this doesn't feel like a \"movie\" in the traditional sense. There's no evolution of characters, no arcs, and the ending may leave some wanting. You can compare it to Michael Mann films where plot and pace are unconventional.\n\nNot sure how the film will perform commercially, given the material is esoteric. If you're a film buff (and enjoy great performances) or you've been in finance, this is a must-see. Other may likely pass.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1070504985", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMTQ0MDE1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzEyMjYxNg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMTQ0MDE1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzEyMjYxNg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A thriller that revolves around the key people at a investment bank over a 24-hour period during the early stages of the financial crisis.", "uploadDate": "2011-08-02T10:40:13Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1615147", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Margin-Call", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Margin-Call/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Margin-Call/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Margin-Call/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-10-22"}
