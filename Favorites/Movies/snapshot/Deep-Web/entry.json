There was some layman explanation about the deep web to set the stage for Ulbricht's story but the title should have been different as it misleads the reader.\n\nSecondly I think Winter did a good job with suspense as I felt I was attracted to the course of events and there were some unexpected turns such as the imprisonment for life in the Ulbricht's case.\n\nThe big downfall is the one-sided stance that Winter took in this movie painting the government as the ones to blame for the victims of the drug war and that it is Ulbricht's idea that should be used as a substitute for drugs on the street! It does that and also includes a story of a minor who purchased meth from the deep web so the movie kinda contradicts itself! it only sides with Ulbricht's story and is not able to give the full picture! it sounds very like a pro anarchism pro free will movie that assumes all people are good!\n\nI think Winter should consider doing another movie to clarify what led the to life sentence for Ulbricht if he is to be an unbiased ideology-free director.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1048161817", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1Mjk5MTIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE1Njk0NDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1Mjk5MTIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE1Njk0NDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A documentary that looks into the online black market Silk Road and the arrest of its alleged founder Ross Ulbricht.", "uploadDate": "2015-02-19T12:33:04Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3312868", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Deep-Web", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Deep-Web/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Deep-Web/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Deep-Web/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Deep-Web/thumb.jpg"}
