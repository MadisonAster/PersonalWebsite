So he sends a group of ruthless killers (young assassins) to find and finish him. The movie is based on a graphic novel: \"Polar: came from the cold\". Although I've not read the comic but I can guarantee that the team has done justice with stylish action choreography and gun fights full of gore, contains brief nudity plus appealing cinematography and music add-on to make it 'next' in violent movie genre. The cast comprises of Katherine (Vivian), Vanessa (Camille) and equal amount of shares for Ruby(Sindy), Matt (Blut) and guest appearance from Knoxville (Michael). It is a must watch if you're fan of movies like John Wick, Punisher and Equalizer. Since it is based on a graphic novel , the one-liners are really awesome before the kill:\n\nVivian: Heard you stopped smoking? The black Kaiser: \"Figured, it wouldn't kill me\"\n\nI don't know what critics are going to rate it but this movie has everything which can give a high dose of adrenaline rush.
