The most stunning things were definitely NOT given away in the trailers. Fight sequences move extremely fast, but after watching a couple of them your eyes should be used to it and it won't seem so confusing. Cloud has a wide array of swords, and I kinda wish things were moving a LITTLE slower just so we could see them, because they were each incredibly detailed. Oh, and we finally get to see exactly how one equips Materia...\n\nMusic: brilliant also. I was a bit nervous about it, since (from what I've seen) Nobuo isn't the best at writing music to go along with action (remember the Steal the Tiny Bronco sequence?), but it's brilliant and it fits perfectly. I'm glad I preordered the OST. They changed the lyrics to One Winged Angel though, so you won't be able to sing along if you know the Carmina Burana Lyrics.\n\nPlot: the first half of the movie sets up things and introduces everyone in a fairly complex tapestry, but the second half is almost entirely fight sequences, once all the players are in place. I wouldn't call it a weak plot, but it's nowhere near as convoluted as the game's plot was. I think this is in an effort to avoid trying to overshadow the game, and I think that's a good thing...the movie is its own entity, and shouldn't try to top the original in terms of sheer plot.\n\nI admit, I was kind of hoping that this movie would bring FF7 to a wider range of people, but this is NOT a mainstream movie. I was going to give it only nine stars, just because it doesn't even really try to explain anything to newcomers...Marlene (at least I think it was Marlene...sounded like her) gives a bit of background at the beginning, but it's more of a refresher than a crash course. But then I realized, for me this movie is a 10/10, so why should I take off points just because other people probably won't like it as well...if you've played the game, or are at least passingly familiar with it, you should see this movie. But you don't need me to tell you that. If you're not familiar with it, go out and buy it, sit there for twenty hours and beat it, and then see the movie...although even without any background, it's still stunningly beautiful. You just won't get any of the inside references...which make up 50% of the movie (that is, everything that ISN'T a fight sequence).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi150209049", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwN2Q4ZmItNTIxOC00MWNlLTg4OGYtMzBiZWE2YTQxMDc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwN2Q4ZmItNTIxOC00MWNlLTg4OGYtMzBiZWE2YTQxMDc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Blu-Ray trailer for this animated action film", "uploadDate": "2009-06-13T03:45:40Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385700", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Final-Fantasy-VII-Advent-Children", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Final-Fantasy-VII-Advent-Children/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Final-Fantasy-VII-Advent-Children/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Final-Fantasy-VII-Advent-Children/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Final-Fantasy-VII-Advent-Children/thumb.jpg"}
