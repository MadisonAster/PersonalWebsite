It is pretty damn awesome. The fights are fantastic and the magic is really cool! It's totally like a video-game in parts, with some amazing hand-to-hand combat in there.\n\nThis film is for the fans: \"To those who loved this world once before and spent time with its friends, gather again and devote your time...\" Besides this ominous opening, the story was not very hard to follow, and Ihave never played a Final Fantasy game. I think it pays to be familiar with Role Playing Games in general; knowledge of the genre kinda helps you grasp some of it better. I think though that if you pay attention, and accept what the film throws at you, it's quite easy to understand. There is a lot that isn't explicitly explained, and if you demand that it should be then you will probably be confused and irritated.\n\nWatching the film is like being dropped into the middle of some grand saga, and having to put as much of the puzzle together as possible. I like that approach; you get caught up in the mystery and confusion that all the characters are going through. But like I said, just be accepting. If a weird red lion thing that talks, turns up and starts kicking ass and taking names, and the other characters just say he's an old friend, accept it and move on; you don't need a biopic flashback, or a tell-all sit-me-down. You are an observer here, of something beyond your experience and undestanding.\n\nSo: fantastic graphics and animation, great voice acting, cool video game styled music, involving story and characters, and maybe some of the coolest fights you'll see in a while. It's worth seeing, and while it IS for the fans, it is perfectly accessible for people like me that have never played the games.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi150209049", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwN2Q4ZmItNTIxOC00MWNlLTg4OGYtMzBiZWE2YTQxMDc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmIwN2Q4ZmItNTIxOC00MWNlLTg4OGYtMzBiZWE2YTQxMDc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Blu-Ray trailer for this animated action film", "uploadDate": "2009-06-13T03:45:40Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385700", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Final-Fantasy-VII-Advent-Children", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Final-Fantasy-VII-Advent-Children/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Final-Fantasy-VII-Advent-Children/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Final-Fantasy-VII-Advent-Children/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-22"}
