                          'more accurate word, a roller-coaster. With dramatic '

                          'not up to par with the game - but then again, the '
                          'game could spend 40+ hours developing these points '

                          'league. Instead, the movie took the more sensible '
                          'approach - to expand on the action and try to place '
                          'as many inside-jokes and themes into itself instead '

                          'in the game. The lack of Materia usage also caused '
                          'me some controversy - the story of the movie chose '
                          'to use little (though not ZERO) Materia, and '
                          'instead lots of supernatural fighting ability and '
