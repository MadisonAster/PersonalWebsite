Stephen King is unpredictable at best and he delivers again with this movie. I would love to say that you will watch it from start to end and know and understand the story line and meaning of the film but I'd be lying. It keeps you wondering and guessing throughout and gets weirder as it progresses. Yet, I was compelled to keep watching. I think it's interesting and has a deeper connection and meaning to life and the choices we make or should have made. Watch it and make up your own mind, but I loved it! My other half however, was asleep within the first 45 minutes.
