I love most of the classic movies but this is definitely the best film i have ever seen\n\nMat Damon played a great part, showing the full spectrum of emotions in his role.\n\nI've ever gone out and bought the soundtrack to the film, i've watched it half a dozen times and always go right through to the final credits.\n\nPure brilliance!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H6M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Good Will Hunting", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1575984665", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA4ZTY4YWItY2JkMS00NjQ1LTg4MDQtM2NkNWQ2ZTU5YmYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA4ZTY4YWItY2JkMS00NjQ1LTg4MDQtM2NkNWQ2ZTU5YmYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2011-10-26T03:24:21Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Good-Will-Hunting", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Good-Will-Hunting/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Good-Will-Hunting/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Good-Will-Hunting/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Good-Will-Hunting/thumb.jpg"}
