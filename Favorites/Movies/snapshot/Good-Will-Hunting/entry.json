The introduction and exposition sections are enormously engrossing, after which script peaks and rather coasts along the rest of the way.  Yet, the casting is so well done, and the acting at such good level, that interest is nicely maintained.\n\nWhat \"Hunting\" essentially consists of is some two dozen conversational scenes, bridged together with short transitions of physical activity.  What is rather remarkable is that one isn't aware of the dramatic limitations comprising the structure.  This is a real tribute to the cast, director, and of course, the script. While the basic situation is really quite far-fetched, it is made to seem plausible--again, the mark of good, convincing writing.  The story behind getting the script sold and produced on the terms of the writers' preferences is fascinating.  Still, one can't really call it luck, for both Damon and Affleck \"paid their dues\" -- and success did not just fall into their laps.  These are two talented young men, with perseverance; and how wonderful for them to have achieved such success while still youthful and full of vitality. \n\n\"Good Will Hunting\" is a good production, with solid craftsmanship in all departments -- thanks to the  creativity of Damon and Affleck.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H6M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Good Will Hunting", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1575984665", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA4ZTY4YWItY2JkMS00NjQ1LTg4MDQtM2NkNWQ2ZTU5YmYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA4ZTY4YWItY2JkMS00NjQ1LTg4MDQtM2NkNWQ2ZTU5YmYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2011-10-26T03:24:21Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119217", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Good-Will-Hunting", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Good-Will-Hunting/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Good-Will-Hunting/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Good-Will-Hunting/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
