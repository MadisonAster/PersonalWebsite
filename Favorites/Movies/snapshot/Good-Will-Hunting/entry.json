I love most of the classic movies but this is definitely the best film i have ever seen\n\nMat Damon played a great part, showing the full spectrum of emotions in his role.\n\nI've ever gone out and bought the soundtrack to the film, i've watched it half a dozen times and always go right through to the final credits.\n\nPure brilliance!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1575984665", "name": "Good Will Hunting", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA4ZTY4YWItY2JkMS00NjQ1LTg4MDQtM2NkNWQ2ZTU5YmYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA4ZTY4YWItY2JkMS00NjQ1LTg4MDQtM2NkNWQ2ZTU5YmYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2011-10-26T03:24:21Z"}, "url": "/title/tt0119217/", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
