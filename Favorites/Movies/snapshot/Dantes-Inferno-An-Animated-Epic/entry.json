He goes to Hell, going through all nine levels(including the sewer one), engaging many creatures(most from other mythologies than the Christian one... and this *does* criticize the theology some, if I'd have liked it to do so to a greater extent)... fortunately for him, he can cut through most of them with his sword or a scythe... getting to the deepest one where the devil wants to marry his wife, because apparently even the lord of evil can't screw someone if there isn't a ring on that finger... hey, don't ask me. This is based on a game I've never played and barely know anything about. The voice acting is OK, but I wish they'd speak up, or turn the volume down on the otherwise good FX. It is fun, fast-paced, and has good action, except for when you can't tell the dimensions or where people are in relation to one another. Epic? Sure, if that doesn't require an actual story. The animation varies, partially because they keep changing who does it. There is a ton of bloody, gory violence and disturbing content and some nudity and sex in this. I recommend this to fans of bad-assery that has to do with religion in some way. 7/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7", "worstRating": "1"}}, "url": "/title/tt1401113/"}
