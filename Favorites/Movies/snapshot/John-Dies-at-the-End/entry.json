The end is almost Austin Powers like (i.e. silly). The technical quality fairly good but it is never able to get over the weak story line in the second part of the movie. I imagine Paul Giamatti's involvement was to lend a bit of credibility to the project. However, it is fairly clear that his scenes were shot in a single day (all are in the same Chinese restaurant), so the result is actually the reverse since the commercial motive of the casting is so evident. To sum up, they had me interested at the start and hopeful in the middle but bored and disappointed at the end.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "No. 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi643671065", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMTY0ODI5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzE3NTg2OA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwMTY0ODI5Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzE3NTg2OA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A pair of college dropouts who can barely hold down jobs are enlisted to save humanity from a paranormal, psychoactive drug that promises an out-of-body experience with each hit.", "uploadDate": "2012-11-01T15:47:16Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1783732", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/John-Dies-at-the-End", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/John-Dies-at-the-End/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/John-Dies-at-the-End/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/John-Dies-at-the-End/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-08-21"}
