I am not upset with the quality of the film, but the way it left me feeling after being reminded of the corruption and pain from my past cases.\n\nThe film makers did and excellent job of compressing an extremely complicated topic into a well organized and an easy to understand presentation. I was not sure I was going to learn anything new, because I thought I had seen everything. Anyone who has been through a divorce or custody battle has a decent understanding of how the corrupt Family Court system operates. I was unpleasantly surprised to learn some new facts and injustices that I had not seen before. The corruption has always been obvious to me, but I didn't understand the motivation to the level the film exposes.\n\nThe narration by Dr. Drew was perfect. People who know nothing about Family Court can watch this film and follow it. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone considering marriage, or anyone who is just starting out their divorce or custody action. For most of us, we didn't have the luxury of knowing how corrupt the family courts were until we were neck deep in tears and debt. Thanks to this film, many others will be able to walk into their unfortunate situations with a clearer expectation. The movie revived my promise to myself to stay single until the day I die.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi270247961", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0MTAyMzA5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgxNDM3MDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0MTAyMzA5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgxNDM3MDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An expos\u00c3\u00a9 of the inner workings of the $50 billion a year U.S. family law industry that shines a bright light on the waste and collusive practices seen daily in family courts.", "uploadDate": "2013-12-04T11:09:32Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2636456", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Divorce-Corp", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Divorce-Corp/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Divorce-Corp/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Divorce-Corp/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Divorce-Corp/thumb.jpg"}
