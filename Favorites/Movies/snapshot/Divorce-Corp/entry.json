Yes, business, as we are informed that this is a $50 billion/yr. industry, and the average divorce (including related child custody issues) costs $50,000. As the movie opens, we are introduced to a guy in Cincinnati who tells the tragic story of how his second wife, not long after they have a little boy, pulls the rug from under his feet and is able to not only ruin his finances and reputation but also to keep him from seeing his own son. As the movie progresses, we come to know others (in Memphis, Dallas, etc.) who have similar blood-boiling stories to tell. To tell you more specifics of the documentary would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see it for yourself.\n\nCouple of comments: first, even though examples are pulled from across the country, the documentary as a whole is heavily California-focused, perhaps not a surprise since it seems California is on the cutting edge of many divorce/custody battle strategies (and they do mean \"battle\"). Second, what really gets under your skin is the vested and interlinked interest that EVERYONE involved except the families themselves, has to keep this \"industry\" going and growing. The documentary does a great job contrasting this with the situation in \"Scandinavia\" (mostly examples from Iceland, some from Sweden). Third, kudos to writer-producer-director Joe Sorge for bringing us this riveting, and revolting, assessment of divorce, and family courts in general.\n\nThis movie showed up a few weekends ago on a single screen for all of Greater Cincinnati. I figured this wouldn't be playing long so I went to see it a few days ago. I had a private screening, as in: I was literally the only person in the theater. No matter, this is an excellent documentary. Whether you can check it out in the theater or on DVD/Blu-ray, \"Divorce Corp.\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi270247961", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0MTAyMzA5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgxNDM3MDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0MTAyMzA5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgxNDM3MDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An expos\u00c3\u00a9 of the inner workings of the $50 billion a year U.S. family law industry that shines a bright light on the waste and collusive practices seen daily in family courts.", "uploadDate": "2013-12-04T11:09:32Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2636456", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Divorce-Corp", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Divorce-Corp/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Divorce-Corp/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Divorce-Corp/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Divorce-Corp/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-04-16"}
