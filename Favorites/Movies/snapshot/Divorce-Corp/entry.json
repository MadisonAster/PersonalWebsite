However, if you, too, fall into a similar situation, it does not mean you shouldn't see \"Divorce Corp\"--in fact I think every American should as the film brings up many instances of judicial malfeasance that we SHOULD be aware of and which should make us angry. Imagine a court system with almost no oversight or right to appeal and whose aim is NOT a speedy resolution of family tragedies--whose ultimate aim, in many cases, is to bleed as much money from the divorcing couples as possible. And, imagine a system where what's best for the kids is sometimes unimportant. Welcome to the US family court system--where endless regulations, delays and costs practically bankrupt a person wanting a divorce. Learn about all this and more in this very hard hitting and interesting film. But also be prepared to finish the film feeling angry...\n\nAnd, by the way, if you are considering divorce, you may just want to watch this one first. After all, the idea of an easy, non- contested and inexpensive divorce is just about extinct and the acrimony that is to come is something to consider.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi270247961", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0MTAyMzA5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgxNDM3MDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0MTAyMzA5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgxNDM3MDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An expos\u00c3\u00a9 of the inner workings of the $50 billion a year U.S. family law industry that shines a bright light on the waste and collusive practices seen daily in family courts.", "uploadDate": "2013-12-04T11:09:32Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2636456", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Divorce-Corp", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Divorce-Corp/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Divorce-Corp/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Divorce-Corp/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-04-16"}
