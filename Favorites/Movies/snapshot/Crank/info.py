                          'do with many films. The previews made it look like '
                          'it had a clever story, but I was worried that with '
                          'Jason Statham playing lead, I might just get a '

                          'obnoxious way either. In the first minutes of the '
                          'film we are set up with a possible story of '
                          'corruption between hit men, a botched job, and the '

                          'only solution-- get the adrenaline pumping and keep '
                          'his heart rate up! The whole movie is like one long '
                          'action sequence, with pauses for story elements. '
                          'This is the common thing now in films, but in other '
                          "movies, it generally doesn't work so well. But, "

                          'they all relate to Chelios. Some of it went over my '
