Statham does a great job in the role of Chev Chelios a hit-man who's poisoned with a Chinese cocktail that cuts off the adrenaline in his body so in order to stay alive he must keep moving at any cost or he's dead. Statham brings a fierce intensity to the character and he's earned this role after everything you see him do in the movie. Major props to Statham because he really shows through his performance the adrenaline boiling up in his character ready to explode at any minute and he stays like that for the majority of the movie. Well done. Statham's co-star Amy Smart plays Eve whose his totally oblivious stoner girlfriend and she does a good job with the role. She might not get a lot screen time but she makes for a believable clueless girlfriend. She's also featured in \"spolier\" two scenes I can't even write about in this review. For those of you have seen it you know which two scenes I'm talking about. The rest of the cast including Efren Ramirez, Reno Wilson, and Dwighty Yoakam are admirable in their roles but like Smart they're not given much to do. Directors Mark Neveldine and Bryan Taylor show some real talent with this film making it an edgy action thriller that's very different from any other one you've seen before. Overall Crank was better than expected but with some flaws with the dialgoue at times, some of the shaky camera work, and the ending could've been better. Other then that though Crank is packed with plenty of action with is basically non-stop from the start, solid performances from most of the cast especially Statham, and some small does of humor that make for an entertaining action thriller to watch.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H28M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Crank", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3364028953", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2FlZTk5N2EtMTY5ZC00NTE5LWIwNmUtOTdhMWVjYTVhNGZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2FlZTk5N2EtMTY5ZC00NTE5LWIwNmUtOTdhMWVjYTVhNGZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A man with an hour to live exacts revenge on his murderers in this trailer", "uploadDate": "2009-05-31T03:28:05Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479884", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Crank", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Crank/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Crank/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Crank/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
