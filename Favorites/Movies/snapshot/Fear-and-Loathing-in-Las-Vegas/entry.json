One of the many outstanding characteristics, besides a flawless performance from its main actors, excellent direction, and maybe the greatest achievement, one of the few literary adaptations that don't have you leave the cinema with disappointment, is the visual interpretation of the influence of LSD and other psychedelica. Though it has been tried many times, in 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' it has been done in a way that in my opinion deserves an Academy Award like 'Best Visual Interpretation', were there one like that (btw, number 2 in my psychedelic charts is, interestingly, a scene from 'The Simpsons', episode 809, 'El Viaje de Nuestro Jomer (The Mysterious Voyage of Homer)', where Homer eats super-spicy chili made from Guatemalan chili peppers grown by mental patients- that causing him an incredibly accuratel realized 'trip').\n\nWell, I guess up until now you, the reader, can guess that I am one of those that loved the movie, and think it to be a mile stone in cinematographic history, along with 'Apocalypse Now', 'Pulp Fiction' or 'The Matrix'.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H58M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: Criterion Collection", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2996149273", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk4NGQ4ZjItODE5My00MjNiLWE2NjYtMjNhYWE3OGY3YThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk4NGQ4ZjItODE5My00MjNiLWE2NjYtMjNhYWE3OGY3YThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Three Reasons Criterion Collection Trailer for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas", "uploadDate": "2011-06-23T03:16:26Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120669", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fear-and-Loathing-in-Las-Vegas", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fear-and-Loathing-in-Las-Vegas/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fear-and-Loathing-in-Las-Vegas/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fear-and-Loathing-in-Las-Vegas/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fear-and-Loathing-in-Las-Vegas/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
