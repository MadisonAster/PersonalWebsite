This film is based on the \"true\" story of when the notorious reporter Hunter S. Thompson and his then attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta went to Las Vegas to cover a bike race for rolling stone magazine but instead spent the entire trip going out of their minds on various illegal and legal chemicals. This may sound like a one trick pony for stoners and 60's throwbacks but I am neither and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Very few films based on books manage to tell the story or capture the spirit of the original but F&L certainly manages both. The story sticks closely enough to the book without alienating the books fan base but also trims out the right areas so that the film doesn't become overly long and uninteresting.\n\n      The film is still fairly long, compared with most popcorn fare, at around 2hrs and does sag a little in places but the pace quickly picks up again. The performances are absolutely spot on with Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro virtually becoming their characters. Both are heavily disguised under make-up but their acting ability shines through. On first viewing I wasn't that impressed, it was a good film but not a great film, but after a second viewing I fell in love with it. You notice things and pick up on gags the second time around that you missed the first time. You immerse yourself in their world so much that you feel like you were there with them on the \"trip\" in both senses of the word. I have shown this film to most of my friends and they also have become hooked after viewing the film twice, it's such a shame that this great film works like this as I'm sure there are many people who are unwilling to give it the second chance it deserves. If you haven't seen this film I suggest you do and if you don't like it see it again. If you have seen this film and didn't like it, see it again.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H58M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: Criterion Collection", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2996149273", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk4NGQ4ZjItODE5My00MjNiLWE2NjYtMjNhYWE3OGY3YThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk4NGQ4ZjItODE5My00MjNiLWE2NjYtMjNhYWE3OGY3YThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Three Reasons Criterion Collection Trailer for Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas", "uploadDate": "2011-06-23T03:16:26Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120669", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fear-and-Loathing-in-Las-Vegas", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fear-and-Loathing-in-Las-Vegas/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fear-and-Loathing-in-Las-Vegas/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fear-and-Loathing-in-Las-Vegas/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fear-and-Loathing-in-Las-Vegas/thumb.jpg"}
