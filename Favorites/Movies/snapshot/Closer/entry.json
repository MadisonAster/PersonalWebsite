The lies, the half-truths, the inability to distinguish truth from lie after being told so many lies. I could completely relate to the characters in this movie.\n\nThough I could laugh with it, it was nevertheless painful to watch. I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone except my ex-. Even then, I have trouble believing she's understand any part of it.\n\nThis particular film was more like a documentary shot without the shaky hand-held camera. But, like the still photographs the movie mocks as being false, Closer allows only glimpses of the truth behind the myriad lies.\n\nI want to be entertained at a movie and I cannot think of a single person to whom I'd recommend this movie. It was very well acted, scripted, and executed on all parts. But it was more painful than pleasant or enlightening.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Closer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2308413465", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyYmFjNGUtZThlZS00NGRkLTk2ZDgtYzAxMDZiODNlMTA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyYmFjNGUtZThlZS00NGRkLTk2ZDgtYzAxMDZiODNlMTA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Closer", "uploadDate": "2010-12-11T06:09:14Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0376541", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Closer", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Closer/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Closer/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Closer/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Closer/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-09-14"}
