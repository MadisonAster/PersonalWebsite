The humor is good, the dialogues are fine and the actors never overact.  General Partridge (Kelsey Grammer) forgets that the business of war begins with providing good material to the troops. Colonel James Burton (Cary Elwes) knows this and he delivers a speech to the test-company that must make a demonstration of the Bradley troop transporter.  The senatorial commission cannot understand that the development costs of the vehicle lasted for 17 years and costed 14 billion dollars.  The hearings and questions of that commission provides one of the most humoristic scenes of the movie and are unsurpassed by other political movies.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144550", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Pentagon-Wars", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Pentagon-Wars/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Pentagon-Wars/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Pentagon-Wars/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
