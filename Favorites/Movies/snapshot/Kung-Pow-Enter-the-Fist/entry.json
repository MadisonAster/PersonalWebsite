After I saw the movie I quickly went out and bought all six in the series and loved everyone, now the humor in these movies is the stupid off the wall type that I love. Now Kung Pow is the same way and has the most random unexplainable humor that I have seen in a movie. Now I personally love this kind of humor but not everyone does, so I would say if you saw any of his other movies like Ace or Juwanna man these are more \"normal\" movies and aren't good to go by. But if you have seen the thumb movies or just love weird humor you will love this movie, I loved but that doesn't mean you will, so my advice is if you don't like stupid comedy don't watch this but if you like that kind of stuff you should check it out.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H21M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Kung Pow: Enter the Fist", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi429195545", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQyZmVmYzgtZDQ2OS00MGMxLWE3ZjgtNjJlZjdhYmMxMTE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQyZmVmYzgtZDQ2OS00MGMxLWE3ZjgtNjJlZjdhYmMxMTE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:56:35Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240468", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kung-Pow-Enter-the-Fist", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kung-Pow-Enter-the-Fist/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kung-Pow-Enter-the-Fist/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kung-Pow-Enter-the-Fist/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kung-Pow-Enter-the-Fist/thumb.jpg"}
