I think it goes without saying but this is mainly going to appeal to South Park fans, although I'm someone who hasn't watched the shows in ages yet it still kept me entertained and reminded me what a funny show it actually is. I really enjoyed seeing all of the behind the scenes stuff that's gone over as it really lets you in to see how tough the job actually is. Some of the best stuff happens in the writer's room where they discuss how for every one great idea they have a hundred bad ones. We see how they come up with the ideas, work them out and how they ultimately decide on whether or not to use them. From here we see the vocal work that has to be done and then of course there's the animation. The episode the guys are working on here is the one where Cartman keeps saying his mother is \"screwing\" him. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are both interviewed throughout the process and we also get a brief history of how the show started and their trip to the Oscars."}, "duration": "PT42M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2076781", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/6-Days-to-Air-The-Making-of-South-Park", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/6-Days-to-Air-The-Making-of-South-Park/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/6-Days-to-Air-The-Making-of-South-Park/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/6-Days-to-Air-The-Making-of-South-Park/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/6-Days-to-Air-The-Making-of-South-Park/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
