Clearly it was designed to fit within an hour of television, but I would think they could have put more for those who did not watch the original run (I saw it on Netflix, for example). There was not much discussion of the movies these guys made, and how films like \"Cannibal the Musical\" fit into the story of Parker and Stone.\n\nThat aside, I think it was a good peak at how these guys work, and it is interesting to see Bill Hader in on the fun, too. I knew some episodes were made last minute, but I was not aware that the show consistently worked that way. It is an amazing feat.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT42M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2076781", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/6-Days-to-Air-The-Making-of-South-Park", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/6-Days-to-Air-The-Making-of-South-Park/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/6-Days-to-Air-The-Making-of-South-Park/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/6-Days-to-Air-The-Making-of-South-Park/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
