Not only because I am so terribly interested in the exploration of space and the historical events that have taken place - but because it's a great film with excellent performances and a truth-telling style. Heck, even Lovell's wife dropping the wedding ring in the shower the day of the launch is true!\n\nJust the fact that this film is true makes it even more enjoyable. It's hard to understand how in the hell one can make it back to Earth and survive with a fatally crippled space-craft. It's even harder to appreciate just how close they actually got to dying out there.\n\nThe performances are astounding. Ed Harris is just stupendous as Gene Krantz, and Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Garty Sinise and Bill Paxton (who seems to always get the role as the whiner...) are also great.\n\nAs Hanks put it: this story is one of the greatest ever. The question is, how do you get home? That question is as old as humanity itself.\n\nYou can tell he put his heart and soul into this one. And the fact that this happened to the American space explorers is hardly noticeable.
