If it inspires the viewer to read the book or the work/s of P.K.Dick then it has done its job. The animation format used had no influence on my viewing pleasure,it was neither good nor bad,it did not distract me from the theme of the movie. Keanu Reeves I thought was decent in the role of Bob,whether this is due to the colouring effect or not is debatable. Seriously though,Mr Reeves has a limited appeal as an actor to me,but I actually thought he did a good job. I read the book 20 some years ago and enjoyed it immensely,as always the film can never convey the entire book,but I was finally pleased it made it to film in a semi faithful way.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "A Scanner Darkly", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3384017177", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODllNzNkYzEtMDRlZi00ODAxLWI4NDktYWNmZGRiYjU3YTJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODllNzNkYzEtMDRlZi00ODAxLWI4NDktYWNmZGRiYjU3YTJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Warner Independent Pictures", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T07:45:00Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405296", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/A-Scanner-Darkly", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/A-Scanner-Darkly/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/A-Scanner-Darkly/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/A-Scanner-Darkly/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/A-Scanner-Darkly/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
