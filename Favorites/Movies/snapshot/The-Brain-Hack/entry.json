Twenty minutes is just not enough to bring a story like this one. The idea though is good. I can see a longer movie being interesting with this story, but now it just fell undevelopped and unfinished. The acting and cinematography are okay as well is the story. It could be a good sci-fi thriller movie with the right funds and actors. The idea is there, it just needs the right people and more money to finish this story. Did I see God in the end? No I didn't, like nobody else ever did unless they are liars or schizophrenics.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT20M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3704676", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Brain-Hack", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Brain-Hack/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Brain-Hack/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Brain-Hack/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-02-19"}
