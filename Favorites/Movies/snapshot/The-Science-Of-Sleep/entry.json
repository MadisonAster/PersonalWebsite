A love story, emotionally rich with dazzling dream-like visuals, done the old-fashioned way with simple stop-motion animation techniques. We see St\u00e9phane flying above his cardboard imagination of Paris and later, we see him sitting in the bathtub full of silver cellophane. It's Gondry's first film as writer-director after a two-feature partnership with Philip Kaufman. Not surprisingly, it feels a bit Kaufmanesque, as Gondry's previous \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\", but now dreams have replaced memory. \n\nSt\u00e9phane can hardly make the distinction between his own dreamworld and the outside reality and doesn't know a whole lot about love. For no apparent reason he lies to St\u00e9phanie that he lives next door to her, which results in some comic situations. He also wants to be an inventor and so he gives her his 3-D glasses, 'but the world is already in 3-D', she replies. He is a man-child, unable to adjust himself to the everyday realities of the outside world. \n\nUltimately the relationship between St\u00e9phane and St\u00e9phanie ends in a kind of stalemate, and so does the film itself. How do you end a film? With most films I can't wait till it's over, but here it seemed like the last twenty minutes got lost in the editing room. A very abrupt ending. The film might have a bit of an unsatisfying resolution, but Gondry creates magic here. It's the dreamworld that makes this rise above the level of just another romantic comedy, and it's funny, very funny. The breathtaking stop-motion animation is a feast for the eye and the sets and creations are wonderful to look at. The film had me in a permanent smile.\n\nCamera Obscura --- 8/10"}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Science of Sleep", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4260954393", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjVkNDlkY2YtN2UzMi00NDlkLThhNzUtZDQwZDk1ODg4YWNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjVkNDlkY2YtN2UzMi00NDlkLThhNzUtZDQwZDk1ODg4YWNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:09:52Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0354899", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Science-Of-Sleep", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Science-Of-Sleep/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Science-Of-Sleep/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Science-Of-Sleep/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-25"}
