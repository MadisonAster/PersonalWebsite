This movie is so insanely good and just plain insane at the same time. The movie follows Gael Garcia's character as he moves back to his mothers home in Paris and finds himself falling for the girl across the hall. Gael's character experiences reality through dreams and the present, creating all sorts of confusion. The movie has some of the most unique props and eccentric animation pieces I have ever seen, but would you expect anything less from Gondry (Eternal Sunshine..). This movie really can't be described in truth but holds so much potential for multiple viewings as its so full of life and visual wonders for the eyes. Gael Garcia is just perfect in this role and is fascinating in gesture and laugh out loud funny when the script allows. I think you should definitely look forward to seeing this movie when it gets a wide release, its funny, its art, its pleasure for the eyes and a puzzle for the mind.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Science of Sleep", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4260954393", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjVkNDlkY2YtN2UzMi00NDlkLThhNzUtZDQwZDk1ODg4YWNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjVkNDlkY2YtN2UzMi00NDlkLThhNzUtZDQwZDk1ODg4YWNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:09:52Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0354899", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Science-Of-Sleep", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Science-Of-Sleep/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Science-Of-Sleep/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Science-Of-Sleep/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Science-Of-Sleep/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-25"}
