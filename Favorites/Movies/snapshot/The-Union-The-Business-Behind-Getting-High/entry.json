However, as a documentary, it has some issues.\n\nFirst, let me get the 'cons' out of the way. I will say the production values are low, however, some of the best documentaries are shot on shoe string budgets by people that really just have something they want to say! The music can be too prominent, monotonous, and a little irritating at times. It also doesn't fit the subject matter at points. Stock footage is a little over done, and over edited. Also, you really know right off the bad where the film makers stand on the subject matter! It can feel quite one sided at times, and can present some of the street people being interviewed as naive with uneducated points of view.\n\nHowever, all that being said, there were a LOT of well made points that came up! The film makers take you inside the operations, and show you first hand how this world operates. He interviews some big names, and asks a lot of the big questions and covers a lot of areas that we never quite hear about.\n\nEven if it's not the best documentary (and I'm not even sure how that standard could even be set...) this is one that you should take in! It'll be worth your time!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Union: The Business Behind Getting High", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi327260185", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGFiNTM5YmYtNGJjMC00NjZjLThmZjMtOGQ5ZWJjODk2NTJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGFiNTM5YmYtNGJjMC00NjZjLThmZjMtOGQ5ZWJjODk2NTJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Union: The Business Behind Getting High", "uploadDate": "2010-12-16T06:31:54Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1039647", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Union-The-Business-Behind-Getting-High", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Union-The-Business-Behind-Getting-High/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Union-The-Business-Behind-Getting-High/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Union-The-Business-Behind-Getting-High/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
