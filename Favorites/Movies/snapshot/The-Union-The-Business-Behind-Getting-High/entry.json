This is one of the best as it is one of the most comprehensive as well as nicely edited and thoughtfully produced.\n\nThis is not a stoner film, a statement of \"I have a right to get to stoned and no one should infringe on this in and of itself\", even though this is a perfectly valid argument if you believe at all in real freedom and the US Constitution. Rather, this is a documentary that exposes the horrific, astronomical price the US pays to continue the current marijuana prohibition.\n\nSadly, this film will be, for the most part, preaching to the choir. Few who have opposing views will watch it and be swayed to examine the fallacies within their belief system. Not because of the presentation or production value of the statements within the film, but rather man and woman's ability to continue to believe the most ridiculous and destructive foolishness regardless of the amount of overwhelming logic and reality that contradicts their beliefs. The billions of those who feverishly practice religions of intolerance and other faith/magic based beliefs as well as many of the horrific conditions in America presently, such as the record setting Prisons for Profit system and other tragedies are ample proof as to the idiotic self and other destructive nature of so-called humanity.\n\nWatch this film anyhow, whether it outrages you or just is another piece of evidence as further proof of man's and woman's squandered opportunity to have a great society. It is quite well done and will provide you food for thought, that is if you dare to think.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Union: The Business Behind Getting High", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi327260185", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGFiNTM5YmYtNGJjMC00NjZjLThmZjMtOGQ5ZWJjODk2NTJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGFiNTM5YmYtNGJjMC00NjZjLThmZjMtOGQ5ZWJjODk2NTJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Union: The Business Behind Getting High", "uploadDate": "2010-12-16T06:31:54Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1039647", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Union-The-Business-Behind-Getting-High", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Union-The-Business-Behind-Getting-High/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Union-The-Business-Behind-Getting-High/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Union-The-Business-Behind-Getting-High/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Union-The-Business-Behind-Getting-High/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
