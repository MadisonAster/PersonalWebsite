                          'material tackles a rather mature subtext, otherwise '

                          "larger scale. It's clearly destined to be a movie, "
                          "it might as well fit in today's blockbuster trend "
                          'of post-apocalyptic settings and revolution '

                          'standard in comparison. While it still wonderfully '
                          'realizes the most grotesque moments of its source '
                          'material, the characters are watered down with less '

                          'interesting is hardly existent in this adaptation.\n'
                          '\n'
                          'How the main characters are introduced is painfully '

                          "represented as unlikely heroes, but Eren's arc is "
                          'basically just trying to win back his girl and '
                          'living up to that image, it makes him look lousier. '
                          'What makes this character originally interesting is '
                          'the fact that he is a traumatized kid who is too '

                          "perfect or spectacular, but it's impressive enough "
                          'to take these exciting moments into live action. '
