He meets the stranger Elise Sellas (Emily Blunt) hidden in the Waldorf's toilet and she tells that she had crashed a party and the security guards are chasing her. They start a conversation and they immediately fall in love with each other. However the guards find her and David does not see her again. However she inspires him to make a remarkable speech. \n\nOne day, David is traveling by bus and he meets Elise again. She gives her phone number to him and David promises to call her. However, strangers wearing hats approach to David and tell that they belong to the Adjustment Bureau and Elise and David must be kept apart. They destroy the piece of paper with her phone number and David is unable to contact Elise. Three years later, David sees Elise walking on the sidewalk. He gets out of the bus to meet her and he learns that she is a dancer. But the strangers use their abilities to keep them apart. What is the reason why David and Elise can not be together?\n\n\"The Adjustment Bureau\" is a romantic and suspenseful sci-fi based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, the writer of \"Blade Runner\", \"Total Recall\", \"Impostor\", \"Minority Report\", \"Paycheck\", \"A Scanner Darkly\" and \"Next\", among other sci-fi films. The intriguing story is ambiguous; the chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is wonderful; and it is always great to see Terence Stamp. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Os Agentes do Destino\" (\"The Agents of Destiny\")", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H46M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Adjustment Bureau -- Super Bowl Spot", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2215418393", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MTE3ODMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE4MTQyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MTE3ODMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE4MTQyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Adjustment Bureau -- Super Bowl Spot", "uploadDate": "2011-02-05T17:20:12Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1385826", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Adjustment-Bureau", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Adjustment-Bureau/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Adjustment-Bureau/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Adjustment-Bureau/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Adjustment-Bureau/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
