Throughout the documentary you can't help but feel for these kids who have had upwards of seven years of their life thrown away due to greed and selfishness of the authority figures. Though the documentary travels on both sides of the fence (between the judges fault and not the judges fault) the bulk of the film views the head judge as this overly conservative man who has only his own interests in hand. \n\nOne great documentary and never gets boring. Though the documentary will polarise views of the situation, anyone who is interested in this case will be glad they had watched this gem.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H42M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Kids for Cash", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi108374041", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmJiMjcyNDUtYmU3Yi00NzE1LWE3ZDQtZjc3YjhhYzI4ZmNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmJiMjcyNDUtYmU3Yi00NzE1LWE3ZDQtZjc3YjhhYzI4ZmNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Kids for Cash", "uploadDate": "2013-12-14T07:39:18Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2925642", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kids-for-Cash", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kids-for-Cash/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kids-for-Cash/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kids-for-Cash/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kids-for-Cash/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-08-11"}
