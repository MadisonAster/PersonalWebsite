            'reviewBody': 'It is one of the most disturbing stories of just '
                          'how greedy and corrupt people can truly be. In '
                          '2000, Luzerne County Pennsylvania needed a new '
                          "Juvenile detention facility, but couldn't afford "
                          'it, so they privatized it. Leading the group that '
                          'won the contract, were two of their own Juvenile '
                          'court judges. That alone was a grey area, but not '
                          'the issue. Soon, the judges learned that the more '
                          'occupants the jail had, the more money the facility '
                          'would receive from the state. So, despite the law, '
                          'which requires juvenile offenders to be sentenced '
                          'to the least restrictive environment possible, kids '
                          'as young as thirteen, with no previous record, were '
                          'being sent to JV for very minor offenses. As a '
                          'result, the facility was receiving millions from '
                          'the states, which the judges were embezzling. As '
                          'the scandal unfolded, this documentary was filmed '
                          'and shockingly, both judges agreed to be a part of '
                          'it, claiming they were always tough on juvenile '
                          'crime and had done nothing wrong. Judges never '
                          'comment on cases and defendants are always advised '
                          'not to talk to the media, but for some reason these '
                          'judges did, and the way they justify their actions '
                          'is truly sickening. There is even one scene where a '
                          'mother confronts one of the judges outside of court '
                          'house, holding a picture. She says to him, this is '
                          'my son, he was fifteen when you put him in jail for '
                          'drinking some beers and fighting with other teens. '
                          'He served three years and within six months of '
                          "being released he killed himself, and that's your "
                          'fault. The judge could care less, it was truly '
                          'amazing. The documentary is an eye opener and it '
