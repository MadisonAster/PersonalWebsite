Why?  Because it then proceeded to dominate the majority of my thoughts for the rest of the day.  That night I lay in bed, tossing and turning, my mind trying to wrap itself around the story, and I absolutely could not GO TO SLEEP!  \n\nI finally just gave up on sleep, got up around midnight, and watched \"Election\" to cleanse my palate.  Then I went back to bed and starting contemplating \"Memento\" AGAIN.  Finally, out of sheer exhaustion, I went to sleep.\n\nThis is a movie that gets in your head and will not get out until you figure it all out.  And that can only be done with extensive internet research. Reading \"Memento Mori\", the short story upon which the movie is \"based\" helped, too.\n\n\"Memento\" is nothing short of a phenomenon.
