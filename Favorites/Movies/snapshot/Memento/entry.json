If, on the other hand, you are open-minded, creative, and alert, you'll definitely appreciate and get a kick out of this one. \"Memento\" is an old-fashioned \"film noir\"-type mystery thriller with an intriguing, ingenious twist: outfitting the entire film with a style that mirrors the protagonist's own mental condition while giving the poor viewer(s) his own perspective as well. It is masterfully filmed and edited in such a way that it is chronologically presented backwards (with two initially separate, parallel storylines - the main one, shot in colour, is the chronologically-backwards story with scenes that intercut with those of the other story, which is filmed more like a documentary, shot in black & white, and mostly takes place inside a motel room with the main character narrating, talking about the effects of his condition, etc.) While the average viewer may already be put off by such a complicated, confusing format, it is a very original premise that is well worth the struggle to figure out.\n\nActing is solid across the board, as is the writing, directing, etc., but special kudos must be extended to the very talented editor Dody Dorn, who successfully managed to put all of these fragments together and help them flow in a smooth, healthy manner that is not easy to pull off.\n\nOne of the most \"memorable\" (sorry, couldn't help slipping in the bad joke) films you're likely to ever see, \"Memento\" is an instant classic due to its groundbreaking narrative style and impressive dramatic undertones. For those jaded moviegoers who seek something to keep them awake, interested, and constantly thinking, there couldn't be a better choice than this film."}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Memento", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3220356889", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODhmZDI0MWEtNWIzOS00YjBjLWE0YjgtYzdlOTY4MGQ0N2VlXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODhmZDI0MWEtNWIzOS00YjBjLWE0YjgtYzdlOTY4MGQ0N2VlXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer", "uploadDate": "2019-10-11T17:10:11Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209144", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Memento", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Memento/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Memento/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Memento/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
