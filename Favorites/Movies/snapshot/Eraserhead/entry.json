I'm a great fan of Lynch's Wild at Heart having seen it four times, and recently loved Lost Highway. But this one left me baffled. I'd heard of it for years, but can make little sense of it. It certainly didn't bore me, in fact I was fascinated to see where the plot led. Tried to analyse it in terms of symbolism, but decided that if I have to do that the film isn't really speaking to me. The dark broodiness is impressive, the squishiness repulsive, and Henry's hairdo is unforgettable!"}, "duration": "PT1H29M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074486", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Eraserhead", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Eraserhead/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Eraserhead/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Eraserhead/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Eraserhead/thumb.jpg"}
