Having said that can't you see the similarities in style and content? \n\nSaying Lynch is weird is like saying the Beatles wrote good pop music. Lynch's weirdness can effect one on a very profound, almost spiritual level, eg Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks.\n\nEraserhead is a hard film to enjoy but it's well worth the effort, if only for Jack Nance's superb visual performance, and a deeper appreciation of Lynch's mis-en-scene."}, "duration": "PT1H29M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074486", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Eraserhead", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Eraserhead/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Eraserhead/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Eraserhead/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Eraserhead/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
