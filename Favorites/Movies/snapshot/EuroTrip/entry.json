Eurotrip uses almost every single clich\u00e9 or stereotype regarding Europe & exaggerates it enormously in an unbelievably funny way.\n\nSurprisingly the acting, which is done mainly by unknown actors & actresses, is very good. As for Michelle Trachtenberg, she is just plain awesome. Her acting deserves real praise. Plus, the film features several pretty successful cameo appearances. Lucy Lawless as S&M dominatrix is particularly hilarious.\n\nThough the story itself can't be considered particularly original, the movie is interesting, cause of unstoppable flow of hilarious jokes. The theater was almost torn down with the viewers' laughter, when I watched the film. The scene with The Pope is an instant classic in my point of view, I haven't seen something this hilarious since the first Scary Movie came out. Some satirical aspects also take place in the movie: especially funny was the scene, when the characters arrive to a club in Slovakia & hear a techno remix of a song 'Scotty Doesn't Know'. Awesome moment.\n\nIn general, I think the film is underrated. In my opinion it is better than the first & the second American Pie, the second Scary Movie & a great number of less famous comedies. Go see it & have fun.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "EuroTrip", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2946826521", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2NjM2IwNGMtZTIzYS00NWIxLWI3NTEtZjc4ZmM4NTcxMzJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2NjM2IwNGMtZTIzYS00NWIxLWI3NTEtZjc4ZmM4NTcxMzJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for EuroTrip", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:02:13Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356150", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/EuroTrip", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/EuroTrip/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/EuroTrip/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/EuroTrip/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/EuroTrip/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-20"}
