It looked like another stupid teen comedy to me. I was so surprised at how hilarious this was. I was rolling on the floor laughing my ass off. My new favorite song is \"Scotty Doesn't Know!\" And while this movie doesn't properly represent Europe and it's style and it's culture, it does enlist every stereotype Americans have about Europeans, and that's what makes it so damn funny. This movie is definitely one of my new favorites, and is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. If you just want to laugh at everything that's wrong with the world, then this is totally something you need to see.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Trailer for EuroTrip", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2946826521", "name": "EuroTrip", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2NjM2IwNGMtZTIzYS00NWIxLWI3NTEtZjc4ZmM4NTcxMzJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2NjM2IwNGMtZTIzYS00NWIxLWI3NTEtZjc4ZmM4NTcxMzJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:02:13Z"}, "url": "/title/tt0356150/", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-20"}
