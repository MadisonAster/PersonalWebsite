Ridley Scott - the renowned director of Bladerunner - has made a film of quite a different genre, so a real departure from his usual stuff, but I have to say he has come in with what I felt to be a very watchable film with some pretty complex characters thrown in. Nic Cage gets to display a good range of his acting skills. He really is the master of the facial tic as anyone thinking back to some of his earlier films (such as Vampyr's Kiss') will recall. To those who scoff at his recent choice of projects e.g. G-Force, just remember, he is an actor. You take the work while you can. Anyway, to summarise, for me, above all, this film was refreshing as all of the actors acquitted themselves really well. A polished piece of cinematography that I will definitely enjoy viewing again.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H56M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Matchstick Men", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3415539993", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDU5ZDdlMTAtYjk1NS00NDgzLTgwNmItYWI5MTYwMzU0ODBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDU5ZDdlMTAtYjk1NS00NDgzLTgwNmItYWI5MTYwMzU0ODBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "hv-post", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:59:03Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325805", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Matchstick-Men", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Matchstick-Men/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Matchstick-Men/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Matchstick-Men/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
