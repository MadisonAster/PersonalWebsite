I'm not normally a fan of Bradley Cooper, however i was amazed to see his acting talents here and how true he was to a real chef. Definitely a game changer for his career after being unimpressed with him in hangover or wedding crashes.\n\nIf you have a passion for anything i think you'll like this film, it simply displays every aspect of what people go through when they're putting everything in their being into something, when it's all in, all or nothing, life and death.\n\n9/10. A must see for all food lovers.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H41M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Burnt", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2849159193", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWU3MjY1OWQtNTgxYS00NjExLTk5MzAtMzUwMWViNTZhNDdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWU3MjY1OWQtNTgxYS00NjExLTk5MzAtMzUwMWViNTZhNDdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Burnt", "uploadDate": "2018-02-01T17:04:39Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2503944", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Burnt", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Burnt/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Burnt/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Burnt/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Burnt/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2016-02-22"}
