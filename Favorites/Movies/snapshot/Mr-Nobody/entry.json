I lost track of how many parallel lives the main character was remembering, and as far as I could tell, it was never really explained how he could be aware of so many parallel universes, but those are minor points in a film that seeks to bring up ideas to be pondered. And it does just that. I think this would be a great first date movie, because the potential for it sparking a meaningful conversation/debate is tremendous. The main point, of course, is that every decision we make affects the path that the rest of our life takes, and there are many of these turning points in a lifetime. There are also ideas about the nature of reality, which I found intriguing. I don't think it will be long before I give this a second view. The only criticism I have is that, even though there were some fairly dramatic moments, and the acting was good, I didn't feel particularly connected to the characters. There was much more of a sense of detachment than I would have liked to have seen in a movie like this. But all in all... great film. A must see for anyone who likes to ponder life's imponderables.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H21M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi23832857", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MjQ5ODgyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk3NjAyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MjQ5ODgyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk3NjAyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A young boy stands on a station platform.
