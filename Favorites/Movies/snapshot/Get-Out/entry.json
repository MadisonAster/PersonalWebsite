The movie creates a very unsettling feeling from the beginning that slowly builds to a crescendo, that forces the viewer to see prejudices head on. When all is said and done, you now have kind of a bird's eye view of what is wrong with society. But besides that, it hints a Hitchcock-type of thrill that is sure to deliver Goosebumps. A HUGE congratulations to Jordan Peele for hitting a HOME RUN, his first time up to bat. Looking forward to future projects from him.
