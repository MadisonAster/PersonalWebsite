It's not a horror film. It's not a comedy. What it is, is a suspenseful thriller of the highest level, worthy to be compared to Hitchcock caliber. The humor is there, along with a few horror scenes, but not enough to overshadow the main theme of the story. The film hits all cylinders with almost no misfires. As far as complaints that the film is racist, it is not. It would work just as well with an all-black or all-white cast. Those complaints are from people who are uncomfortable with black people or interracial relationships and are letting it distract them from the narrative of the film. I most certainly hope that it reaches the wider audience that it so richly deserves.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2005186073", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDI0NjU3MTc3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc5MTMyMDI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDI0NjU3MTc3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc5MTMyMDI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "When a young African-American man visits his white girlfriend's family estate, he becomes ensnared in a more sinister real reason for the invitation.", "uploadDate": "2016-10-05T05:37:22Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Get-Out", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Get-Out/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Get-Out/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Get-Out/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Get-Out/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2017-05-14"}
