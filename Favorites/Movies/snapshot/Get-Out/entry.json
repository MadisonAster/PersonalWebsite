Rather than having in your face predictable jump scares and cheesy music, Get Out dwells on the mind and relies on the fear of the unknown while giving subtle messages on racism and what's it like to be black in America and for an anti-racism movie everything is handled very well due to Peele's great writing. As I've already mentioned the best aspect of Get Out is the writing; the characters are intelligent people and behave like logical human beings instead of clich\u00e9 horror movie idiots. Everything happens for a reason and there is a meaning behind everything. Also unlike other horror movie clich\u00e9s Get Out doesn't fake its scares or replaces them with needless humour. Instead, the humour (mainly Lil Rel Howery's character) is perfectly balanced with the story and shows up at adequate times.\n\nCreepy, unsettling and filled with brilliant performances (primarily from Daniel Kaluuya) and even better writing, Get Out perfectly represents the US society in its current era.\n\nFinal Score: 8+/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2005186073", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDI0NjU3MTc3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc5MTMyMDI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDI0NjU3MTc3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc5MTMyMDI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "When a young African-American man visits his white girlfriend's family estate, he becomes ensnared in a more sinister real reason for the invitation.", "uploadDate": "2016-10-05T05:37:22Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5052448", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Get-Out", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Get-Out/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Get-Out/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Get-Out/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2017-05-14"}
