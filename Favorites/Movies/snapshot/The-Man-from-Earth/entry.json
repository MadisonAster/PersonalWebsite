Lots of small inputs of educational facts and figures but stay alert as they come quick and fast. I thought the mix of characters was excellent and the tale outstanding, but that is down to Bixby the writer. The acting was a little wooden but the story-line was fast enough (after a slightly slow start) to save dwelling on this. A sci-fi film with absolutely no special effects, relying solely on the story and a room-full of actors.\n\nA highly recommended film that needs some concentration and thought to fully appreciate, and that might even cause a tear if you become fully immersed. A nice change from the usual no-brainer special effects charged tear-aways.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H27M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Jerome Bixby's The Man From Earth", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi479396121", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2IwZGI1MzAtZTdhYS00OWEyLThkZmEtNGFiNmJlYTc0YjRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2IwZGI1MzAtZTdhYS00OWEyLThkZmEtNGFiNmJlYTc0YjRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Starz!", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:49:45Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Man-from-Earth", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Man-from-Earth/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Man-from-Earth/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Man-from-Earth/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Man-from-Earth/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
