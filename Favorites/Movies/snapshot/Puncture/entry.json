It was gripping from the opening credits and I was emotionally pulled in a number of directions. Chris Evans proved he can really act, not just dress up as a superhero and run around a big budgeted set. Mark Kassen was marvelous alongside him as his legal partner and the Houston backdrop made for an unlikely protagonist in and of itself. A story that needed to be shared and with tremendous talent. I only wish there were more films like \"Puncture.\" I encourage people to go see the film.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "A David and Goliath law drama about a drug-addicted lawyer who takes on a health supply corporation while battling his own personal demons.", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3910179865", "name": "Theatrical", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg0NjMwMjQ0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU2NzQzNg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg0NjMwMjQ0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU2NzQzNg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2011-08-18T08:37:14Z"}, "url": "/title/tt1582248/", "EntryAdded": "2011-11-17"}
