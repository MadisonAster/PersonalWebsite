Puncture has everything going for it. It has a Good cast and potentially a good story but directors Adam and Mark Kassen have made a real pigs ear of this one.\n\nThis is the story of Mike Weiss , a talented lawyer , who with his partner , chose to take on the might of the drug companies and hospital administrators to get them to use a syringe that will save thousands of lives. The trouble is , Mike Weiss is partial to using needles himself as he has a bad drug habit.\n\nThe Mistake they made with this film is they concentrated too much on Weiss and not enough on the battle with pharmaceutical companies. The film builds up the story to the point of an exciting court case then It just ends Finish,. No court case .Just a lazy bit of on screen information at the end describing what happened. It's as if the money ran out and the directors and cast just walked away.\n\nPuncture is a big disappointment and it's no surprise this was tucked away on a movie channel and not on the cinema."}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3910179865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg0NjMwMjQ0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU2NzQzNg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg0NjMwMjQ0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU2NzQzNg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A David and Goliath law drama about a drug-addicted lawyer who takes on a health supply corporation while battling his own personal demons.", "uploadDate": "2011-08-18T08:37:14Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1582248", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Puncture", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Puncture/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Puncture/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Puncture/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-11-17"}
