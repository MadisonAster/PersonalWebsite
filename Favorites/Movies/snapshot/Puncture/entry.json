Starts slow, by the end you are rooting for a drug addict.  Not a usual thing. I say B+", "reviewBody": "\"Sometimes the brightest light comes from the darkest places\" This is the true story about Mike Weiss (Evans) a personal injury lawyer who takes on a huge health supply company after one of his clients is infected with a dirty needle. The client is a nurse in a hospital that uses plastic needles that are re-used over and over. Mike wants to make it so every hospital only uses the one time use only needles that his other client manufactures. The only problem is that Mike is a drug addicted mess. This movie is deceiving. The first half hour to me was a little slow and wasn't sure if I could make it through. When it picked up, it really picked up and sucked me in. By the end of the movie you are very engrossed and are pulling for someone you normally wouldn't. A movie much like \"Runaway Jury\" mixed with \"The Lincoln Lawyer\", not quite as good as \"Lincoln Lawyer\" though. Overall, a very good law movie that will make you think. I give it a B+.\n\n*Also try - Lincoln Lawyer & Runaway Jury", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3910179865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg0NjMwMjQ0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU2NzQzNg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg0NjMwMjQ0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTU2NzQzNg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A David and Goliath law drama about a drug-addicted lawyer who takes on a health supply corporation while battling his own personal demons.", "uploadDate": "2011-08-18T08:37:14Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1582248", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Puncture", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Puncture/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Puncture/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Puncture/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Puncture/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-11-17"}
