Ferrell and Wahlberg are hilarious", "reviewBody": "Will Ferrell is back since the disappointing \"Land of the Lost\"! Who knew Mark Wahlberg could be genuinely hilarious? \"The Other Guys\" is the latest comedy to poke fun at the buddy cop genre, but this one is one of the best because the actors and director knew what they were doing.\n\nFerrell and Wahlberg have terrific chemistry and both of them have perfect comedic timing. But let's not forget the other supporting actors (too many to list here), as all of them have some memorable and quotable lines.\n\nThe jokes weave through slapstick and crude territory, while not being overly vulgar and overdone. The story is actually pretty engaging, as it is a genuine cop mystery at its core, but it is used as a vehicle for all the jokes to come in. And the jokes kept coming and had the entire audience laughing as well, this one the loudest compared to the previous Steve Carell entries \"Date Night\" and \"Dinner For Schmucks\". Sorry Steve, this year Will and Mark stole the audience.\n\nHaving said that, the production design, cinematography, editing, stunts/special effects are good, and the direction by Adam McKay is lighthearted and brisk. McKay is seriously becoming a big name in comedy film directors, and here is another memorable feather in his cap.\n\nOverall, if you are in need of a laugh, see this movie A.S.A.P. This one is one of the funniest movies in years, and that's being honest.\n\nOverall rating: 73/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Other Guys: International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1253639705", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MTI1MzI2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM0MTk1Mw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MTI1MzI2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTM0MTk1Mw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Two mismatched New York City detectives (Ferrell and Wahlberg) seize an opportunity to step up like the city's top cops whom they idolize -- only things don't quite go as planned.", "uploadDate": "2010-06-22T07:44:54Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1386588", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Other-Guys", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Other-Guys/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Other-Guys/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Other-Guys/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Other-Guys/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
