So I never felt the urge to write/contribute something....\n\nThe film:\n\nFirst of all I never wrote a review on this website before. And to be honest i don't think this will count as a review. Actually it was never my intention to write a review but more so to ask a critical question... Is this still a documentary? The quality of the images, the story and of the film in general are mind blowing! It gets you thinking and shows you the good, the bad and the ugly (pun intended).The story itself and the people involved are real, but in my opinion this is a reenactment! Staged, beautifully done but staged... The subject and the way they showed it is compelling, brutal at times, and it will get you thinking but I can't lose the feeling i watched a movie/film and not a documentary... Which is either brilliant or bad... Help me out, your thoughts pls.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H40M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Cartel Land", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2916268057", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThlOWRkN2QtODE4Zi00OWMxLWJhNzgtZmFkMzE2MjNjOTZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYThlOWRkN2QtODE4Zi00OWMxLWJhNzgtZmFkMzE2MjNjOTZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Cartel Land", "uploadDate": "2018-02-01T17:05:08Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4126304", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Cartel-Land", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Cartel-Land/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Cartel-Land/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Cartel-Land/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-10-02"}
