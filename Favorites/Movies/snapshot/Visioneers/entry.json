The best example of a true black comedy is \"Dr. Strangelove\". Although it's plot revolves around the possibility of the complete destruction of humanity it still manages to be funny from beginning to end. The problem with many black comedies is, although they have an absurd basis, they are just to bleak to be deserving of the description \"comedy\". \"Visoneers\" does manage to supply a handful of mildly humorous moments. Most of the real humor is generated by Zach Galafianakis body language. But, overall, this one fails as a comedy. That might be forgivable if the film turned out to be as original as it's synopsis implies. Unfortunately as the story progresses it degenerates into a low budget clone of Terry Gilliam's \"Brazil\". \"Visioneers\" also borrows way too heavily from other films such as \"Fahrenheit 451\", \"Network\", \"1984\" and even \"Idiocracy.\" Although \"Visioneers\" is not without some merit, there are much better ways to spend an hour and thirty-five minutes", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Visioneers", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi111018521", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4OTE1MjE5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI0MTk1Mg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4OTE1MjE5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI0MTk1Mg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for this dark comedy", "uploadDate": "2009-05-24T05:39:18Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0833557", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Visioneers", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Visioneers/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Visioneers/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Visioneers/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
