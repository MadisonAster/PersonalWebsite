Somehow ZG seems to be exuding the right kind of vibes for this year or something. Visoneers reminded me of a plethora of American movies - Hudsucker, Brazil, 1984 - all mixed into one in a somewhat subdued, indie approach. If you haven't seen any of those movies this movie would strike you odd as it is one to convey a meaning much similar to the J-horror of Kurosawa. Considering the strangeness of the movie I expected the end to be somewhat living up to it, but this is where it kind of veers back to normality which I think may have been done for a proper distribution. If you want to watch it for ZG or have a penchant for movies that make you think go ahead full steam, otherwise just wait for the next ZG one, now that he's almost famous. For attempting to make a movie like this and picking ZG before he was famous, this movie gets my 7/10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Visioneers", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi111018521", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4OTE1MjE5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI0MTk1Mg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4OTE1MjE5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTI0MTk1Mg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for this dark comedy", "uploadDate": "2009-05-24T05:39:18Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0833557", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Visioneers", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Visioneers/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Visioneers/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Visioneers/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Visioneers/thumb.jpg"}
