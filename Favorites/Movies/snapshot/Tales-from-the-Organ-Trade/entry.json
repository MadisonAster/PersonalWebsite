Not always is it done legally!\n\nThe producers, writers and everyone else involved did an amazing job describing their path, their triumph and their luck of opportunity. Kidney disease is a growing problem and it needs to be more talked about. There needs to be more preventative measures (if possible) to avoid needing dialysis and there needs to be more education regarding the symptoms and the like.\n\nI would love to watch it again since I only caught the last hour.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H22M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2518924", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Tales-from-the-Organ-Trade", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Tales-from-the-Organ-Trade/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Tales-from-the-Organ-Trade/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Tales-from-the-Organ-Trade/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-07-02"}
