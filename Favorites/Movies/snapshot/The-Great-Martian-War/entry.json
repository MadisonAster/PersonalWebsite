She watched this by herself on the History Channel and called my father in a complete panic due to the fear that the \"cockroach headed and spider armed\" aliens would return to earth. \n\n This was accomplished due to the use of the CGI aliens being incorporated into actual WW1 footage. Also, the use of actors pretending to be former soldiers were convincing enough to her to prove that this story was real. Apparently, she was shaking and claimed that she couldn't go to sleep until the family was prepared to deal with the looming threat of alien invasion. \n\n So I don't know if this review helps anyone, but if anything it shows how convincing this mockumentary can be and serves as a reminder to not necessarily believe everything you see on TV.
