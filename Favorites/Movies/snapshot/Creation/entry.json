The movie is not only about his struggle to get his book \"the origin of Species\" published, but also his relationship with his oldest daughter. His daughter was at start the only person in his family to approve of his views, something that she as well had to pay for. Een more than him at times.\n\nNow, this is not an evolutionary propaganda film, as a matter of fact I think it managed to stay very neutral. A hard thing to do in my opinion. of course it does not condone the way the characters was treated by the church, quite the opposite actually. If you need me to use the big words to shed light on this film; it will be liked by deists and atheists alike, but goes away from theism. The movie talks about evolution, and that's it.\n\nPaul Bettany as Charles Darwin was incredible. Of course we all may think of Darwin as that old man with the funny beard, but this movie centers around the man in his late 20's, early 30's. Jennifer Connelly (Emma Darwin) is great as always, but the actor who impressed me was Martha West as Annie Darwin, Darwins daughter. Definitely on of the best child actors of the decade. The story is about Darwin and his daughter, and it is beautifully acted.\n\nExcept for a few jumps in time that was momentarily confusing, the production of this film is pretty flawless. Some scenes were Darwin observes nature is just marvelous, and is almost like taken out of a high production National geographic documentary.\n\nI must admit though, I'm not quite sure of why they chose \"Creation\" as the title. I doubt it is an irony, the movie is too respectful for that. Well, I'm sure there's a meaning too it, just don't let it scare you away. \n\nI give this movie a 9/10. This is truly a great tribute to Charles Darwin, and please give it a chance.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Creation", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi764871705", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMjQ4NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTAzOTYwMw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMjQ4NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTAzOTYwMw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "English naturalist Charles Darwin struggles to find a balance between his revolutionary theories on evolution and the relationship with religious wife, whose faith contradicts his work.", "uploadDate": "2009-12-19T15:57:42Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0974014", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Creation", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Creation/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Creation/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Creation/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Creation/thumb.jpg"}
