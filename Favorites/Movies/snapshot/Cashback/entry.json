He goes to work at a grocery store, where his imagination and eccentric coworkers help him through the breakup and put a little romance back into his life.\n\nThere is some artistic nudity, where our protagonist sketches various men and women in the buff; none of it seems gratuitous, it's just one more part of the film. I'm a big fan of artistic nudity, although I have to admit I've never been able to get chicks to strip down in the supermarket as they do in this film. It's a talent, certainly, that every man could use.\n\nOverall, it's a slightly offbeat romantic comedy of the sort we could use more of. Not formulaic, not predictable, but enjoyable and entertaining. I watched it with my girlfriend, who refused to pose artistically afterwards, but you can't have everything. I've noticed that romantic movies don't necessarily translate into romantic activities for the people watching them; there should be a category of movies that does so, although I don't know what it would be.\n\nAll in all, it's a good date movie, good couch movie, just a good movie to watch when you're in the mood for something lighthearted and quirky.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H42M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460740", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Cashback", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Cashback/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Cashback/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Cashback/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Cashback/thumb.jpg"}
