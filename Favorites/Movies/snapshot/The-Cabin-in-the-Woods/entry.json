So if you're looking for a film that you can cradle a scared lady-friend to, this is not the one. \n\nTo anyone who has watched Southpark's Britney Spears episode you will know the parallel that Matt Stone & Trey Parker drew between our modern culture glorifying and then using celebrities up as an ancient sacrifice to the gods to ensure a good harvest. This movie does the same- by creating a reality TV type scenario that the main characters walk into. But it takes it a step further, in showing how the horror movie clich\u00e9s (joker, jock, slut, nerd and virgin) can be seen as a more elaborate version of this kind of sacrifice ; and horror is the genre that supplies an endless stream of blood to satisfy this ancient need. \n\nBut the characters are so much more than clich\u00e9s- in the movie they actually are noticing how they are falling/being cast into these roles and being less and less human, less and less themselves. That in itself has me tipping my hat to the writers. Joss Whedon you clever beast!\n\nAs to it not being pure horror- that's the point of the movie. I was enjoying the commentary that the narrative made while it developed and because i didn't know where it was heading and why things were happening, it kept me on edge and interested to the very end. \n\nAt one point I was sitting there thinking - wow this movie must have been so much fun to make! It was definitely fun to watch.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "No.2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2572394777", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NTI3NDAzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAyODA1Nw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NTI3NDAzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAyODA1Nw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Five friends go for a break at a remote cabin in the woods, where they get more than they bargained for.
