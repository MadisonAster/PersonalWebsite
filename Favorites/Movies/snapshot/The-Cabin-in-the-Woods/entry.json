Not only did it make it's way into my favorite horrors of all time, but it makes me have faith that people can once again create a true horror. Now there are only remakes of horrors, ( Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street ....) or prequels, ( Prometheus ).\n\nThis movie is full of twists and turns you don't know what way it's going to go. It's smart, funny, gory and sexy with fantastic acting by all the cast. I was on the edge of my seat hungry for more.\n\nOverall, I rated this movie a 10 because it deserved it. This was one of the best films I've seen in a very long time and is one that I'll be watching over and over again.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "No.2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2572394777", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NTI3NDAzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAyODA1Nw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NTI3NDAzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDAyODA1Nw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Five friends go for a break at a remote cabin in the woods, where they get more than they bargained for.
