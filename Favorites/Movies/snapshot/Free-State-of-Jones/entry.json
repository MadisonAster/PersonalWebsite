I did a little research on the history it depicts and it was a part of the Civil War that I knew nothing about. I was quite disappointed when the reviews came out and most of the critics rated it very low. If you are looking for a war drama that is non stop action with lots of battles, massive explosions and bloody scenes from start to finish, you will be disappointed. If you like a movie that has good writing, an actual story and good acting, you will like it.\n\nThe movie starts pretty much like any Civil War movie with battles, death and bloody bodies, but it progresses past that to the point where some people rebel against the Confederacy for the atrocities they commit against the southern farmers. The story is well told with some actual dates and facts flashed on the screen from time to time which sort of gives it the feel of a documentary. It helps keep things in perspective without being intrusive.\n\nIf I had anything to complain about, it would be then length and scope of the film. The movie ran about 2-1/2 hours. At about 2 hours, I thought it was over but then it moved into the Klan, voting intimidation and general mistreatment of the freed slaves as well as having a 100 year tie in to future generation. It was as if they tried to jam these events in to make it more politically acceptable to Hollywood. I just felt that they went beyond what the movie was actually to be about.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H19M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2267132953", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3NDQyNTg0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzI1Mzk5ODE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3NDQyNTg0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzI1Mzk5ODE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "As civil war divides the nation, a poor farmer from Mississippi leads a group of rebels against the Confederate army.", "uploadDate": "2016-05-24T15:22:55Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1124037", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Free-State-of-Jones", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Free-State-of-Jones/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Free-State-of-Jones/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Free-State-of-Jones/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Free-State-of-Jones/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2016-09-14"}
