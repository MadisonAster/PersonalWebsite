Upon viewing, you'll realize that there is no way they did not defame themselves.\n\nAbove and beyond that, this is a film every single person who is unfamiliar with offshore banking should see. It describes in accurate, albeit humorous terms, how \"money\" works in some people's hands, vs. how it works in the hands of the normal Joe.\n\nThe cast is made up of amazing actors who give amazing performances, yet as most of us know, that isn't always the ingredient for a great movie. This one went a step further, and gifted us with FACTS. (Not even its many detractors can argue with any conclusive proof that the laws it unveils to the layman are not on the books and being used daily).\n\nBasically, it takes the viewer through the inner machinations of a business run by people who know the law and push the law as far as the law will allow in order to serve their own purposes. People who deal in gauging the value of buying and selling trades and commodities, as easy as they gauge the value of .... and trade in ... other people.\n\nLastly, in going through other reviews here, I can't help but think about how different we all are, and how some people understood and could appreciate such a well presented window into actual business practices and money and how the two affect the average American, and how others seemed to take simple facts, as a personal affront or attack on their political party.\n\nNot WANTING to face facts, does not change fact.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2025307929", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjU3OGMzMjItZTMwZi00Mzc3LTllODgtNTE5ZjU0ZjdmZGFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjU3OGMzMjItZTMwZi00Mzc3LTllODgtNTE5ZjU0ZjdmZGFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "'The Laundromat' follows a group of journalists who uncover the illicit money networks at the heart of the Panama Papers - documents that exposed a huge international system of legal swindling.", "uploadDate": "2019-08-28T14:58:25Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5865326", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Laundromat", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Laundromat/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Laundromat/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Laundromat/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Laundromat/thumb.jpg"}
