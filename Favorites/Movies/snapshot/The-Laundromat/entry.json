Maybe it shouldn't be funny because this is an infuriating reality that could be fixed if...well, if legislators were themselves not corrupt. Yes, the telling of the tale is not done in a totally conventional straight-forward linear way. But it is easy to follow and amusing, even as you feel you should be angry. And of course you realise that this film won't change a thing.
