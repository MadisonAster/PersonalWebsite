I am glad to see that I am not the only person who liked this film", "reviewBody": "I truly do NOT understand why The Postman was attacked as viscously as it was by the film media (there films much more worthy of the Golden Raspberry Awards in 1997).  I loved this film and was very impressed with the loving amount of dedication that it demonstrates on the part of the actors, writers and director.  This was a GOOD movie: it had a strong and intelligent story; excellent and interesting characters; and real feel for the post-Apocalypse genre.  I felt that Kevin Costner's everyman act worked beautifully in this film and created a sense of reality for the character and of his situation. \n\n As far as the sci-fi novel by David Brin, this film exceeded it in every way possible.  Where Brin had to rely on cheezy sci-fi standards (like supersoldiers) to resolve his story, this film does using only two men, both frauds, and both with radically different understandings of what constitutes a proper society.  That is what made this film great (and I rarely use the term great), that this film was essentially an examination of America and what America means.  It was a parable of sorts about the types of men Americans are and what they are capable of (notice that the head bad-guy had a traditional, classical education, while Costner did not; he appreciated these things but they were not at the center of his belief system... I wonder why).  \n\nWhile I do not agree with every aspect of this film (I am a Medievalist and a Platonist, so I don't necessarily feel the same way about the Western Canon that the film-maker may have), I still find it to be a beautiful reflection on the psyche of the American everyman.  America has a tradition of rejecting the absolutist ideals of the past in favor of the pragmatic relativism of today, and I think that this film is a parable of the divorce of America from the traditions of Europe.  \n\nOverall, this is a complex and entertaining film and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in examinations of American culture and tradition, perhaps as a double feature with Citizen Cane (I am not, however, claiming that the Postman was as good a film as Citizen Cane, only that they have a similar theme... what does it mean to be an American?).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Postman", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1861746969", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmJkNzUyYWMtMThjNy00NjZkLWIyOWEtYzg5YTk3MzYzODA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmJkNzUyYWMtMThjNy00NjZkLWIyOWEtYzg5YTk3MzYzODA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Miramax", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:03:30Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119925", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Postman", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Postman/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Postman/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Postman/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Postman/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
