I know why. It is a little saccharine in places and yes, it is not always believeable. But this is one of the few time a screenplay is better than the book it was based on. This film always fills me with such positive energy and hope. it is funny in places, sad in places, tragic and action-packed in places. Costner plays Eric with such a fresh attitude, and you can almost hear the voices in the characters head pulling his loyalties. The cast is perfect and in many places the cinamatography is sublime. The cross cuts are so clever it made my eyes ache with envy that i didnt think of them and the action sequences are fast and timed to perfection. this remains one of my favourite films and in all honesty people should give it a little more respect. no matter what you think of the script and characterisation technicly this film is top draw. Sets, locations, effects and design grab you by the hand and take you someplace you actually want to go. i would much rather make and see films like this than dross like 'chaicago' and 'moulin rouge'. this is a film for grownups with a bit of imagination and respect for the film makers art.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H57M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Postman", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1861746969", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmJkNzUyYWMtMThjNy00NjZkLWIyOWEtYzg5YTk3MzYzODA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmJkNzUyYWMtMThjNy00NjZkLWIyOWEtYzg5YTk3MzYzODA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Miramax", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:03:30Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119925", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Postman", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Postman/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Postman/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Postman/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Postman/thumb.jpg"}
