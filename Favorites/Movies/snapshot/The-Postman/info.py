                          'almost synonymous with the concept of "lousy, '
                          'awful, horrible, terrible, stinking mess of a '
                          'movie." Like "Plan 9 from Outer Space," "Ishtar," '
                          'or "Gigli," it is sometimes invoked in this manner '

                          'friends. But is "The Postman" truly such a horrible '
                          'disaster? I would argue that its bad reputation is '
                          'overdone.\n'

                          'that this could be called a "great" movie. But '

                          'Part of the answer has to do with Kevin Costner. It '

                          'in the wake of "Dances with Wolves") his reputation '
                          'in Hollywood was towering and unassailable. Costner '

                          'expensive yet mediocre duds such as this one, and '
                          'in the end "The Postman\'s" crime is not that it is '
                          'a truly terrible movie, but that it is simply a '
                          "not-great movie that deflated the public's hopes "
