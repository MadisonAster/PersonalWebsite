Great cinematography and excellent acting contribute to this refreshing Sci-Fi/Time Travel film.\n\nRising actress Sarah Snook with a stellar performance is backed by solid performances of both Hawke and Taylor. \n\nSuch movies usually suffer from failed attempts at originality and complexity boarding on confusion. This movie avoids both by not trying to surprise and shock the viewer but rather act more as a mystery novel - unfolding with precision, letting the viewers participate in the events and discoveries to come. Much like a good old Agatha Christie book would successfully do.\n\nThe Spierig brothers keep getting better with each movie and this is a great step forward in what seems to be a promising career.\n\nThere is nothing new under the Time Travel sun but the delivery is excellent which makes this movie worth watching - at least twice, as any good Time Travel movie requires.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "International Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi100904729", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMTIzNzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQwMDE0MzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMTIzNzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQwMDE0MzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A Temporal Agent is sent on an intricate series of time-travel journeys designed to ensure the continuation of his law enforcement career for eternity.
