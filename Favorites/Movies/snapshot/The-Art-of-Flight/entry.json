With a good mixture between big mountain downhill and some of the most impressive jumps you will ever see, \"The Art of Flight\" is not an educational snowboarding movie. It's a piece that shows you several athletes constantly looking to push the limits.\n\nWhether it is skating down while avalanches are being kicked off left and right, whether they are closely avoiding crashing into rocks on a slope that's not even as wide as a car or whether they land jumps that you thought impossible, this movie will leave you in awe most of the time. Adding to that is the spectacular cinematography in beautiful places like Chile, Patagonia and Alaska. This is hands down the best looking snowboarding piece ever made.\n\nThat said, \"The Art of Flight\" could use a little more direction at points and some of the scenes seemed rather pointless. Other movies build up to a grand finale, this one merely shows you a bunch of guys on the hunt for snow - which does not make it any less of a great movie, but leaves you with a feeling that more could have been achieved. There is very little being said about the personal lives of the athletes as well.\n\nIf you're simply looking for big mountain and big air, this is not to be missed. If spectacular images of mountain scenery are your thing, this movie will make you happy. If you're looking for an entertaining movie about snowboarding, you should still go and see this. You might be disappointed though if you're expecting a big story behind it all.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H20M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3382421273", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2Mzg5NTA5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk4NjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2Mzg5NTA5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk4NjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Snowboarder Travis Rice and his friends redefine what is possible in the mountains.
