It's epic camera work makes even Warren Miller look like an amateur. Red Bull helps pull out all the stops, to produce the most wild documentation of the world of snowboarding out there.\n\nTravis Rice, John Jackson, and Mark \"Lando\" Landvik take the world of snowboarding to a new level in the opening scene alone, which sets the tone, and gives you a small taste of what's in store for the rest of the film.\n\nThe crew even gives you a small inside look into their lives during the planning phases and cloudy down days that prevent filming.\n\nThere's not not too much more that can be said about the film beyond \"Epic\" aside from watch the film. It's the only way to fully understand.\n\nGreat sound track. Ground breaking film.\n\nThe Art of Flight."}, "duration": "PT1H20M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3382421273", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2Mzg5NTA5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk4NjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2Mzg5NTA5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTk4NjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Snowboarder Travis Rice and his friends redefine what is possible in the mountains.
