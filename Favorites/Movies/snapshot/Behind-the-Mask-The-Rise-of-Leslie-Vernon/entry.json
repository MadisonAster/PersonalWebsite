It's a black comedy/mockumentary/horror movie that's bloody hilarious. I LOVED it. I can't recommend it enough!!! If you're a horror film junkie, or even if you're not (for example, my boyfriend doesn't particularly like horror films but is fond of intelligent comedy and was right beside me laughing for this one) you should DEFINITELY see this movie! It's so respectful of the genre at the same time that it plays with it... Nathan Baesel, who says he was inspired by Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter really pulls off charming and cheery -- not copying Lecter, but applying the influence to create a new and lovable serial killer (this is what makes him both funny AND creepy - it's impossible not to like him!).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3501785369", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjU1YWRiZGQtNTNjMi00NjkxLTkxZTUtZjY3YjZmNzJmMzg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjU1YWRiZGQtNTNjMi00NjkxLTkxZTUtZjY3YjZmNzJmMzg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Anchor Bay Films", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T12:29:32Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437857", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Behind-the-Mask-The-Rise-of-Leslie-Vernon", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Behind-the-Mask-The-Rise-of-Leslie-Vernon/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Behind-the-Mask-The-Rise-of-Leslie-Vernon/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Behind-the-Mask-The-Rise-of-Leslie-Vernon/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Behind-the-Mask-The-Rise-of-Leslie-Vernon/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2016-10-23"}
