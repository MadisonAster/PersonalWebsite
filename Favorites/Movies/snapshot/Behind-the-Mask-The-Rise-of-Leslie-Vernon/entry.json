I'm not typically one to watch movies that are both Comedy and Horror. But this was definitely a standout film in the Comedy Horror genre. I would recommend Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon to horror film buffs especially. Being a horror movie buff myself, I found that this flick really put the classic slasher films to good use. They formed a sort of method to the slasher's madness and I have to say I loved that. I also appreciated the slight twist at the ending. I would love to see another film like this to be created. It is definitely worth the watch. Although if you are prone to motion sickness, it may be triggered by the moments where a hand-held camera is used. Other than that, I highly recommend the movie!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3501785369", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjU1YWRiZGQtNTNjMi00NjkxLTkxZTUtZjY3YjZmNzJmMzg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjU1YWRiZGQtNTNjMi00NjkxLTkxZTUtZjY3YjZmNzJmMzg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Anchor Bay Films", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T12:29:32Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437857", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Behind-the-Mask-The-Rise-of-Leslie-Vernon", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Behind-the-Mask-The-Rise-of-Leslie-Vernon/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Behind-the-Mask-The-Rise-of-Leslie-Vernon/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Behind-the-Mask-The-Rise-of-Leslie-Vernon/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Behind-the-Mask-The-Rise-of-Leslie-Vernon/thumb.jpg"}
