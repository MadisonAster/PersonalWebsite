Within 28 days one outbreak in London caused entire Britain dead or evacuated leaving behind a blood-thirsty infected population and a handful of solitary normal persons. Civilization came to a halt, society got destroyed while those limited survivors fight for existence among frequent attack by the vicious victims.\n\nSounds familiar? Then what makes \"28 Days Later...\" a classic among a horde of zombie/biohazard movies? Simply a touch of art that Danny Boyle is able to bring what others could not. The others focus too much on extensive, special-effects-controlled, gory action sequences between infected and normals, with heavy background music. But here there's always a tinge of sadness, emptyness, helplessness. Consider that empty London scene with that background music. We found out there's much else to show than just electrifying action or gore to describe the picture of life in this condition that these movies talk about.\n\nThere are mistakes and loopholes in this movie. But that couldn't weaken the otherwise tight-gripping storyline. The greatest achievement of this movie is to make one viewer stay neutral throughout the film, without taking any side in the first place. Because the virus we talk about is simply used as a metaphor. 'Rage' is shown as a social disease. That makes it a 'serious' film, not a flick. Every person, even the harshest critic of zombie horror movies should watch this. 5 out of 5 stars.\n\nOh, did I mention Cillian Murphy was awesome?", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "28 Days Later", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4071817497", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzkzYjhjMGMtZDYxNC00YTI4LWI2MzctZmY4Mjg4YmUyYjRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzkzYjhjMGMtZDYxNC00YTI4LWI2MzctZmY4Mjg4YmUyYjRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T03:10:08Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/28-Days-Later", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/28-Days-Later/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/28-Days-Later/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/28-Days-Later/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/28-Days-Later/thumb.jpg"}
