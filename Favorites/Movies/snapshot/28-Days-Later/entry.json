The plot was highly un-original, but extremely well made. The acting was powerfully preformed, the filming having many \"diagonally tilted camera view\" scenes, giving off more suspense, without the reliance on the overly used \"scary music\". Also, the addition of the alternate ending gave a strong closing to the film. This is the kind of movie that you end up feeling physically drained after seeing your first time. It will suck you in until the end, every time. I seriously recommend seeing this if you enjoy zombie films, you will not be disappointed.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "28 Days Later", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4071817497", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzkzYjhjMGMtZDYxNC00YTI4LWI2MzctZmY4Mjg4YmUyYjRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzkzYjhjMGMtZDYxNC00YTI4LWI2MzctZmY4Mjg4YmUyYjRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T03:10:08Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/28-Days-Later", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/28-Days-Later/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/28-Days-Later/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/28-Days-Later/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
