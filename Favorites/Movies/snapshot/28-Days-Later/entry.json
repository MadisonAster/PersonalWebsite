There are some great characters, that you actually care about, some you'll like, some you'll be glad to see killed, but all solidly performed.\n\nThe story is well written and avoids the clich\u00e9d cheesy scripts that are too often attached to the horror genre. And I must add that the direction is exactly what you would expect from 'Danny Boyle' top class.\n\nFor me though the real difference between this movie and many others made in this genre is as follows - The infected (the zombie like folk) are more menacing, they turn instantly and they move fast, a combination that would instill fear in every one of us.\n\nI don't mean to run down the zombie movie genre - I am a huge fan of most of these films, but lets be honest its been done to death, re-animated and done again, and this was the first movie to break the mould and transcend to a new level.\n\nIf you like your horror flicks, then this is certainly worthy of your attention.\n\n9/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "28 Days Later", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4071817497", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzkzYjhjMGMtZDYxNC00YTI4LWI2MzctZmY4Mjg4YmUyYjRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzkzYjhjMGMtZDYxNC00YTI4LWI2MzctZmY4Mjg4YmUyYjRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T03:10:08Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289043", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/28-Days-Later", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/28-Days-Later/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/28-Days-Later/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/28-Days-Later/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/28-Days-Later/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
