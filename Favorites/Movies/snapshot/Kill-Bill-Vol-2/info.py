                          'Kill Bill Vol. 1, not only the fact that the film '
                          'would then run 4 hours + if it had been shown in '
                          'one piece, but more because showing both films in '
                          'one run might come across somewhat odd. The reason '
                          "I'm saying this, is because Kill Bill Vol. 2 is "
                          'very different in tone and feeling than was Vol. 1. '
                          'The first part was more anger driven and brutal, '
                          'whereas Kill Bill Vol. 2 is more about love and '
                          'disappointment. Where the first part is bloody and '
                          'ruthless, the second one is tender and sore. This '
