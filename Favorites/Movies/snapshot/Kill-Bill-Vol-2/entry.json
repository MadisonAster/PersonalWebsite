So when the movie ends the story is practically 100% finished and I believe that Tarantino tried to do just that, made a two part movie,now the why I don't have any idea, but as the third movie in a franchise is usually the worst and some times destroys the story of the previous two, see for instance Spiderman 3, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines Matrix Revolution and X-men the Last Stand, I think he made a good choice. \n\nIn the Volume 1 the love of Quentine for the Japanese culture and the samurai sword was obvious ,for Christ sake about 65% of the movie takes place in Japan! In this one we see his love for the martial ,but we also have some nit picks of western ,like a sunrise and some more (No spoilers!). I generally like the on equal measure this two flicks, for are really cool and tell a story ark of an kick ass female assassin ,which isn't the norm as we have see in leads role women in a handful of action films, like the Alien and Aliens, Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Mad Max: Fury Road. In summary for the girls ,who want to show to men that they can be lethal, you can add and the two Volumes in your collection.\n\nIn short is a really good Tarantino film as it is usual with is director ,who is among the greatest of the last two decades.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H17M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Kill Bill: Vol. 2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi405667865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjA3OThlOWUtZWZiYi00M2I2LTg0Y2QtNWY2YThjZjE4Y2U1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjA3OThlOWUtZWZiYi00M2I2LTg0Y2QtNWY2YThjZjE4Y2U1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "CT #1, post", "uploadDate": "2008-09-10T03:24:55Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kill-Bill-Vol-2", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kill-Bill-Vol-2/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kill-Bill-Vol-2/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kill-Bill-Vol-2/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kill-Bill-Vol-2/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
