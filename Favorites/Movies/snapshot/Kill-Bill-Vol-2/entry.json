The reason I'm saying this, is because Kill Bill Vol. 2 is very different in tone and feeling than was Vol. 1. The first part was more anger driven and brutal, whereas Kill Bill Vol. 2 is more about love and disappointment. Where the first part is bloody and ruthless, the second one is tender and sore. This does not mean that there is no brutality in this film, but rather that the tone of the film is totally different.\n\n I must admit that it took me some getting used to in the first 20 or so minutes of the film, because I'd expected the film to go on as brutally and furious as the first one finished. It didn't happen. What I got instead was a more story and character driven film, that was filled with emotion, explanations and some good and original fighting scenes.\n\n I have no negative comments on this film I guess. I think the acting was good to very good, with the extra kudos going to Daryl Hannah, who'd let some people to believe that she as just a tall blond who couldn't act in the last couple of years. With this film she manages to show us though, that she just has not been given the right offers. This I must say seems to be some kind of quality of Tarantino, to get \u0091discarded' actors and actresses and give them an opportunity to shine once again. Speaking of Tarantino, although I do realize that with Kill Bill he was an 'hommage' to many of his influences, I just have to say that he is a great director and screenwriter. I mean, the way he directs, the music he chooses to accompany the scenes and the dialog. It's just all top notch. This does not mean that this is the best film I've ever seen, but that it is a good film, which fulfilled it's promises. I mean let us ALL be honest. Who can pull off filming a revenge movie lasting more than 4 hours without it getting dull and boring? NOBODY but Tarantino. Hell, most people can't make complete a good 90 minute flick with this amount of story.\n\n 7,5 out of 10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H17M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Kill Bill: Vol. 2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi405667865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjA3OThlOWUtZWZiYi00M2I2LTg0Y2QtNWY2YThjZjE4Y2U1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjA3OThlOWUtZWZiYi00M2I2LTg0Y2QtNWY2YThjZjE4Y2U1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "CT #1, post", "uploadDate": "2008-09-10T03:24:55Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kill-Bill-Vol-2", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kill-Bill-Vol-2/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kill-Bill-Vol-2/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kill-Bill-Vol-2/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
