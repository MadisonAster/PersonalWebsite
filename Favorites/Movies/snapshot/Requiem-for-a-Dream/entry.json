Thank goodness too, rather than challenge my brain (not hard to do unfortunately) this film went straight for the heart, ripped it out and kicked it around the floor for 90 minutes. As the addictions plunged further into the depths of Hell, I felt myself more and more arrested by the film. I've never left a film shaking or feeling physically ill- not including Pearl Harbour, of course :)  You want to look away, but cannot.\n\nThis movie is by no means flawless, but then again I would like to hope that the flaws add to the gritty reality of the film. The ending was truly the most frightening thing I have ever seen in film- forget the cheap scares of The Exorcist, Psycho and the endless bile of the 'slasher flick', this stuff is REAL.\n\nIn a country amid a 'war against drugs' this is a powerful film which could do more to turn kids away from drugs than any measly government \"task-force\" or classroom lecture."}, "duration": "PT1H42M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Requiem for a Dream", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2156069145", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzFmMzRmMjQtOGNiZS00YjdjLThhNTUtM2M1YzI0NDQ1ZTcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzFmMzRmMjQtOGNiZS00YjdjLThhNTUtM2M1YzI0NDQ1ZTcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Artisan", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:51:51Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0180093", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Requiem-for-a-Dream", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Requiem-for-a-Dream/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Requiem-for-a-Dream/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Requiem-for-a-Dream/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
