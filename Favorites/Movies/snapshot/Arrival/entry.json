Arrival is unlike any movie I've ever seen. It's about love, loss, tolerance, language and non-linear time, wrapped in a science fiction story about our first encounter with extraterrestrials. \n\nUnder director Denis Villeneuve's masterful direction, Arrival takes its time to unfold, but it gradually gets under your skin and commands your attention. The last half hour was one of the most emotional experiences I've had at the movies in a long time. There aren't many movies these days that I would call required viewing, but this is one of them. And Amy Adams is Oscar-worthy in the lead role. In fact, Arrival could also win Oscars for original score, sound, direction and Best Picture.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H56M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Final Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4225807897", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA4Mzg5OTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk4ODg0MDI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA4Mzg5OTY5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk4ODg0MDI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A linguist is recruited by the military to assist in translating alien communications.", "uploadDate": "2016-11-01T22:34:15Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Arrival", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Arrival/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Arrival/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Arrival/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Arrival/thumb.jpg"}
