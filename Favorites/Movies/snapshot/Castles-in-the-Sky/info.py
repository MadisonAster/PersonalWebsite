                          'Scottish engineer Robert Watson Watt is hired by '
                          'the British Government to develop his new idea, '
                          'something which would go on to be known as radar. '

                          'This British historical film is quite light-hearted '
                          'despite the very serious subject matter. Much of '
                          'this comes down to a playful script with quite a '
                          'lot of comic moments between Watt and his team as '
                          'they work towards their goal. But the singular main '
                          'reason is the presence of star Eddie Izzard in the '
                          'central role. He reigns in his comic persona and '
                          "plays the role with seriousness but he still can't "
                          "help but be amusing at times nevertheless. It's a "
                          'very good, measured performance that benefits '
                          "greatly from Izzard's very likable persona; even if "
                          'his Scottish accent was a bit strange some of the '
                          'time! At heart, this is a quite simple and solid '
                          "example of a British period drama. It's elevated "
                          "somewhat though by the simple fact that it's a true "
                          'story about characters who never seem to have been '
                          'given the big screen treatment before. We do care '
                          'for these characters and we want them to succeed, '
                          'so this ensures that we are onside and involved '
                          "throughout. It's obviously a film which has been "
                          'made on a moderate budget, so this means that '
                          'certain decisions have had to be made such as black '
                          'and white archive material showing the horrors '
                          'unfolding in Europe and footage from the movie The '

                          'well into the flow of the film. Otherwise the '
                          'modest budget has been utilised well to ensure the '
                          'period detail is convincing, while the cast as a '
                          'whole are all very good in their respective roles. '
                          'So, all-in-all a very solid little movie about a '
