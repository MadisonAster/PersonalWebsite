                          '2".  Obviously, this was a way better movie!!! '

                          'best horror film in the past 15 years!!!  We wanted '

                          'before.  It was well made and very well edited. I '
                          'loved the split-screens, filters, stock footage, '
                          'use of color, and that infamous slow motion shot (I '
                          'loved that scene!).  Although he borrowed a little '

                          'Massacre," and "Last House on the Left," what great '
                          "horror film doesn't nowadays?  Seriously!! So Mr. "

                          'totally stole the show!! They made horrifying, '
                          'creepy, and relentless screen sickos, and gave me '
                          'hope for the screen villain again (as opposed to '
                          'lame efforts by thugs in cheap masks).  Mrs. '

                          'reasonably liked.  The other three made lame '

                          'Burns, and the cast of "The Hills Have Eyes"!! So '
                          'it was hard to root for them, which was another '

                          'soundtrack, and I loved it!  My favorite song was '

                          'was totally insane!!! People were screaming, '
                          'jumping, laughing, walking out, and commenting '
                          'loudly on how awesome it was!!!  I was surprised '

                          "senses!!!  I definitely can't wait to see it again "
