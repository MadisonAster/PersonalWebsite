I remember hearing that line in a cool trailer I saw while watching \"Urban Legend 2\".  Obviously, this was a way better movie!!! Besides \"Scream,\" and \"Funny Games,\" this is the best horror film in the past 15 years!!!  We wanted blood, and we got it!!! Whoa, that would have been another great line in this \"uber celebration of depravity\" as those lame Universal execs so succinctly called it.  This flick was definitely worth the wait!!!\n\nFirst off, the directing: Rob Zombie gave this film a unique visual style I had never seen in a film before.  It was well made and very well edited. I loved the split-screens, filters, stock footage, use of color, and that infamous slow motion shot (I loved that scene!).  Although he borrowed a little from \"Natural Born Killers,\" \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\" and \"Last House on the Left,\" what great horror film doesn't nowadays?  Seriously!! So Mr. Zombie brought something new to the table, and will hopefully make a great contribution to horror (he has already in my opinion).\n\nSecondly, the acting: Sid Haig and Bill Moseley totally stole the show!! They made horrifying, creepy, and relentless screen sickos, and gave me hope for the screen villain again (as opposed to lame efforts by thugs in cheap masks).  Mrs. Zombie, or Sheri Moon, was totally insane as well as hot! Also, genre veterans Karen Black, Micheal J. Pollard, and Irwin Keyes brought creepiness to their insane roles!  Tom Towles was also good in a good guy role!  The late Dennis Fimple was hilarious as Grandpa Hugo! Newcomers Matthew McGrory and Robert Mukes were disturbing in their roles as Tiny and Rufus. As for the \"victims,\" Chris Hardwick's Jerry was the only one I reasonably liked.  The other three made lame efforts at acting, and need lessons from Marilyn Burns, and the cast of \"The Hills Have Eyes\"!! So it was hard to root for them, which was another twisted feat that Zombie accomplished.  I actually rooted for the villains!!!!\n\nThirdly, the music: I loved the music!! It fit well with the atmosphere of the film!  I own the soundtrack, and I loved it!  My favorite song was the title theme, of course!  I was expecting songs from Black Sabbath, The Stooges, Sex Pistols, Alice Cooper, Deep Purple, King Crimson, Blue Oyster Cult, and other \"creepy\" bands, but oh well.  I was satisfied.  I also loved the film's score.\n\nLastly, the atmosphere at the theater I was at: It was totally insane!!! People were screaming, jumping, laughing, walking out, and commenting loudly on how awesome it was!!!  I was surprised there was such a packed audience, and it was barnone the best theater-going experience I had ever had!!!\n\nOverall, this film is a creepy, intense, amazing, disturbing, and darkly funny attack on the senses!!!  I definitely can't wait to see it again in the theater and to buy the DVD!  Finally, a real horror movie with balls the size of Canada has hit the masses!!!  This gives me great hope for the new wave of horror: the 70's throwback horror film!! There's plenty this year with \"Irreversible,\" \"Cabin Fever,\" \"Wrong Turn,\" \"Jeepers Creepers 2,\" \"Highwayman,\" and the \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" remake!!!  Out of Five Stars: FIVE STARS!!!!!  See this movie!! All Rob Zombie fans, metal music fans, horror fans, or people who want to see a hardcore horror film should go out and see this movie!! If you like it, you're awesome!! If you don't, I guess you're not ready for hardcore horror."}, "duration": "PT1H29M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "House of 1000 Corpses", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi284426521", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzkyZGZhOWQtZTZlYi00NWZkLTk0ZGMtOGUzODhiNDBiOWY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzkyZGZhOWQtZTZlYi00NWZkLTk0ZGMtOGUzODhiNDBiOWY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:47:55Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0251736", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/House-of-1000-Corpses", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/House-of-1000-Corpses/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/House-of-1000-Corpses/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/House-of-1000-Corpses/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/House-of-1000-Corpses/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
