I went today with a friend and after watching Piper I turned to my friend and told her even if Finding Dory was not great, Piper was worth the price of admission LOVED IT. (Finding Dory was good also but could not get Piper out of my head. Came home and looked it up on my computer and was excited to see a little teaser (as they called it) and teaser is correct cause it took you right up to the start of the adventure. Dang it I wanted to see it again. Whoever and however they did this animation needs to do some more of this, shoot I could have watched a how movie on Piper. Okay I know it is a short movie but could you throw in another teaser trailer. :-)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT6M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5613056", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Piper", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Piper/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Piper/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Piper/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2016-10-29"}
