In fact, I rarely watch them period. To me, the films are a bit lazy and offer little, if anything, in the way of originality. Because of this, I was not thrilled when my daughter asked me to take her to see the film \"Finding Dory\". Fortunately, \"Piper\" was highly original and very enjoyable...and was clearly the high point of my evening.\n\nThe film is told with no words and is the story of a very timid baby sandpiper. Unlike the adult birds, it is afraid of the water...particularly when it's hit by a big wave. So how will this adorable little bird overcome its shyness?\n\nThe best thing about this film is the character design. The baby piper is adorable and is a great combination of a more realistic sort of CGI with a slightly cartoony character. Overall, the film was gorgeous and enjoyable...and rather sweet.\n\nUPDATE: This film was nominated for the Best Animated Short Oscar. Considering the quality of \"Piper\" and the sad lot up against it this year, I think it's a shoe-in to take home the trophy.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT6M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5613056", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Piper", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Piper/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Piper/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Piper/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Piper/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2016-10-29"}
