He enjoyed the movie a whole lot and told me he hadn't watched it before because of it's low IMDb rating. That's when I decided to register here and post a comment - I hope I help someone else to watch the movie because it is worth a watch. What I personally like so much about this movie is that it is not just plain vanilla. It actually makes sense and can be a starting point for new thoughts and ideas - something I truly appreciate in a movie.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Beach", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3699966233", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ0NmY3NjYtZmY0OC00OWI2LThhMDktMjlmZGE4OWZjNjMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ0NmY3NjYtZmY0OC00OWI2LThhMDktMjlmZGE4OWZjNjMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:12:07Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0163978", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Beach", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Beach/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Beach/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Beach/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
