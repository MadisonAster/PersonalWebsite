I avoided this film in the past because of this, but thought it would be a good \"soft\" film to watch on video with with a friend and his wife (she doesn't like difficult films).\n\nWhat a revelation! I understand that people who have read the book may be disappointed, but as an uneducated viewer this is a fantastic film! Novel situation, novel location (beautiful images, even though the beach was re-modeled), novel plot, novel characters (all of whom are wildly different yet possible to sympathise with - except maybe for Bugs)... this film has everything in it that I find so desperately lacking in the average Hollywood pulp I'm forced to watch with friends.\n\nAnd I *liked* the fact that the film made a few surprising changes in style... I hate knowing the end of a story at least an hour before it finally grinds its inevitable way there (see any \"action\" film).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3699966233", "name": "The Beach", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ0NmY3NjYtZmY0OC00OWI2LThhMDktMjlmZGE4OWZjNjMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ0NmY3NjYtZmY0OC00OWI2LThhMDktMjlmZGE4OWZjNjMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:12:07Z"}, "url": "/title/tt0163978/"}
