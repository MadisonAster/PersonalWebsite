So bongs/pipes MUST be ART! Have a great 420 and take a nice bong hit for myself, as I will for you!\n\nI would give this movie a definite watch, if not own... So go buy it!\n\nIt appeals not only to bud smokers but also to artists! Or glass-makers that want to improve their scope/talent!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H16M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2123927", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Degenerate-Art-The-Art-and-Culture-of-Glass-Pipes", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Degenerate-Art-The-Art-and-Culture-of-Glass-Pipes/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Degenerate-Art-The-Art-and-Culture-of-Glass-Pipes/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Degenerate-Art-The-Art-and-Culture-of-Glass-Pipes/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-12-19"}
