So bongs/pipes MUST be ART! Have a great 420 and take a nice bong hit for myself, as I will for you!\n\nI would give this movie a definite watch, if not own... So go buy it!\n\nIt appeals not only to bud smokers but also to artists! Or glass-makers that want to improve their scope/talent!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10", "worstRating": "1"}}, "url": "/title/tt2123927/", "EntryAdded": "2014-12-19"}
