Instead, what I got was a very down-to- earth representation of the true grassroots nature of the Bitcoin.\n\nThere was actually zero focus on the money you can make by investing, or really any allusions to the fact that you could invest now and get rich. \n\nIt wasn't a movie telling you about why Bitcoin is great, they showed you. \n\nDefinitely a real \"community\" feel to the movie, no glamour, just the dirt, really. I liked it a lot. \n\nI really think the title \"the Rise and Rise of Bitcoin\" is more fitting to the actual infrastructure and community of Bitcoiners, having very little to do with the price.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi567258393", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdjMmI4YWEtNDM5NS00ZDAwLTkwOGItYzllZDEwNmY4ZGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdjMmI4YWEtNDM5NS00ZDAwLTkwOGItYzllZDEwNmY4ZGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin", "uploadDate": "2014-05-04T05:12:23Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2821314", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Rise-and-Rise-of-Bitcoin", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Rise-and-Rise-of-Bitcoin/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Rise-and-Rise-of-Bitcoin/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Rise-and-Rise-of-Bitcoin/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-10-09"}
