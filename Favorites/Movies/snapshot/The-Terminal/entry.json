Amelia is waiting for her dream to come true for eighteen years, for herself; Navorski's dad was waiting for something he honored so much for his life; and here comes Navorski, who waits for making his father's left dream come true, for fulfilling his promise, for the woman he fell in love, in a \"crack\" between the US and his own country. \n\nHe has done everything for others around him. If there is a great example of \"egoless\", he is one. Letting go ego, is the greatness that even Amelia found out when she gives up and scarifies something most important in her life to help Navorski. \n\nThis simple story conveys some wonderful philosophy for people living in this country busy around everyday for business, families, and so on, to slow down and reflect on something. As the retired officer said to officer Dixon, there is something we can learn from Navorski.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H8M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Terminal", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2012938521", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQxYzk3YWEtZGY4Zi00M2YyLWFiMmQtOWExOTg1MDFjZTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQxYzk3YWEtZGY4Zi00M2YyLWFiMmQtOWExOTg1MDFjZTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:15:21Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362227", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Terminal", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Terminal/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Terminal/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Terminal/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Terminal/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-12-30"}
