Even Johnny Depp does a fine bit of acting here, and it may be his best work in a long time, aside from maybe Jack Sparrow. This could have been disposable Internet fluff, but everyone seems to have taken it about as seriously as you could.\n\nMy only concern is that it might run a bit long. I know it's not very long, but even in its shortness, it tends to get repetitive and they rely far too much on the \"Trump is a racist\" jokes. That seems too easy to me and really takes the bite out of what could have been possible here.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7", "worstRating": "1"}}, "url": "/title/tt5456120/", "EntryAdded": "2016-02-21"}
