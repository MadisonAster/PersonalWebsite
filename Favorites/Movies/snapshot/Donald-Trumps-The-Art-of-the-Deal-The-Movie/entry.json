Personally, I really dislike Donald Trump, and a good satire of him would work extremely well! Also, it's interesting how this movie is a) an adaptation of his book \"The Art of the Deal\" b)is shot as mockumentary, and has a cool visual style, and c) Johnny Depp is playing Donald Trump!\n\nHowever, the movie itself is nowhere near as good as its concept!While I did laugh a couple of times here and there, it was, overall, very unfunny. Most of it is immaturely making fun of Trump instead of packing the movie with little details about Trump's life that would take actual research. I'm ALWAYS impressed when those behind the scenes actually do research on whoever/whatever they're satirizing.\n\nBut, despite the movie not really being funny, I thought Johnny Depp did a pretty great job. He doesn't look or sound much like the real Donald Trump, but his performance is extremely unique and bizarre, and I really found myself enjoying!\n\nAlso, I'd like to comment on the people angrily calling this movie \"propaganda\". I highly disagree with them. It's just a quick little comedy that pokes fun of Trump, it's no \"Triumph of the Will\"! Really, calm down!\n\nOverall, this movie made me agree with what Ron Howard said at the end of the credits.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "duration": "PT50M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5456120", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Donald-Trumps-The-Art-of-the-Deal-The-Movie", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Donald-Trumps-The-Art-of-the-Deal-The-Movie/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Donald-Trumps-The-Art-of-the-Deal-The-Movie/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Donald-Trumps-The-Art-of-the-Deal-The-Movie/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Donald-Trumps-The-Art-of-the-Deal-The-Movie/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2016-02-21"}
