(I didn't have no problems with it because I understand Spanish). Personally I was really impressed by the quality, perfection, and superb acting of this Mexican movie. The movie consists of three different stories connected by one sole incident. Sometimes you will see the same scene from a different point of view. Or you'll see an out of place scene that will make sense later on. The script was exquisite, very loyal to the culture. The direction was brilliant keeping us interested from beginning to end. And the performances were excellent, so natural and real that you felt as if they were people you knew. Be aware there's extreme violence in this movie, and even though there were kids in the theater I went to, this is not a family movie. I don't recommend it for children if you are a responsible parent. This movie deserves an award."}, "duration": "PT2H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Tr\u00e1iler [OV]", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2171189785", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGI5M2EzNDMtYmQ1My00ZDBmLWFiODEtYWZiOTkyOWVkM2UwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGI5M2EzNDMtYmQ1My00ZDBmLWFiODEtYWZiOTkyOWVkM2UwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Original trailer - do not delete without contacting gamazoa -", "uploadDate": "2019-02-15T17:56:45Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245712", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Amores-perros", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Amores-perros/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Amores-perros/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Amores-perros/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Amores-perros/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
