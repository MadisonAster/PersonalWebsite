Others simply won't watch it because of the subtitles. This is a shame, since this is by far the best film I have ever seen come out of Mexico (far better and more complex than the comparably immature \"Y Tu Mama Tambien\"). Here we get an intertwining tale involving dog fights, petty gangsters, a tragically injured model, a cheating husband, an abused teenage wife, and a homeless hit man. As you might expect the homeless hit man becomes the soul of the film, and the dogs serve as a link, reminding us of the violence we inflict upon each other and nature, and the fractured relationships we think beyond repair, but are actually more resilient than we could ever imagine. Brilliantly directed with a great soundtrack and a bigger heart than you might initially perceive, \"Amores Perros\" is a deep, thought-provoking and utterly enthralling film that you will not soon forget.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Tr\u00e1iler [OV]", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2171189785", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGI5M2EzNDMtYmQ1My00ZDBmLWFiODEtYWZiOTkyOWVkM2UwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGI5M2EzNDMtYmQ1My00ZDBmLWFiODEtYWZiOTkyOWVkM2UwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Original trailer - do not delete without contacting gamazoa -", "uploadDate": "2019-02-15T17:56:45Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245712", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Amores-perros", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Amores-perros/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Amores-perros/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Amores-perros/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
