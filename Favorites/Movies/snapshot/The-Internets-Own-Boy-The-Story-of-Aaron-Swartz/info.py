                          'his life to. The film tells a fascinating story of '
                          'young genius deeply involved in the early '
                          'development of the internet including co-founding '
                          'of Reddit. His genius is unquestionable. The film '
                          'really provides a tribute to a talented young man '
                          'and presents a strong case that he was unjustly and '
                          'selectively prosecuted and overcharged by an '
                          'overzealous prosecutor. This prosecution seems to '

                          'present an objective full picture of Aaron. Early '
                          'scenes show home movie pictures of Aaron as an '
                          'adorable precocious toddler playing with his '
                          'brothers. From this beginning it is impossible to '

                          'activities. The interviews are all with his family, '

                          'his own actions including his own suicide. He '
                          'becomes purely a victim of government persecution '
                          'with no real responsibility for his own life '
                          'decisions including his various hacking activities '

                          "question the ethics of Aaron's hacker-like tactics. "
                          "There really aren't any voices raising serious "

                          'documents was truly an appropriate form of civil '
                          'disobedience. He did, in fact, steal millions of '
                          'articles and violate intellectual property rights '
                          'through his actions. He undoubtedly believed that '

                          'a critique of the criminal justice system than it '
                          'is a balanced examination of his controversial '
                          'history which deserves closer examination. The '
                          "filmmaker seems to be too close to Aaron's legacy "
                          'to present a truly objective self-critical '

                          'view of open access to knowledge and information. '
                          'While it is easy to argue for that view, it '
                          'overlooks the complexity of case for protecting '

                          'defeat the SOPA bill than when he is stealing '
                          'copyrighted materials. This showed his remarkable '
