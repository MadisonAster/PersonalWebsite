Apparently, free access to scholarly and scientific journals must be restricted to protect the people from themselves.\n\nThere is also the issue of civil disobedience in general and the ways those in power portray such actions and those who encourage them. As one other reviewer here states, \"when you commit an act of criminal civic disobedience, you should do so accepting that you will most likely pay the price for that action\". That is true, however, as Gilbert and Sullivan suggested, the punishment should fit the crime, especially when, as in this case, the \"crime\" is questionable at best. I wonder how the current US administration would view the acts of Gandhi or Mandela were they occurring now and posing a threat to their political status quo and not seen safely through the rear view mirror of history. It wasn't that long ago that many in power in America considered Mandela , in particular, a \"terrorist\". \n\nThis excellent documentary is a cautionary tale that all free thinking and well meaning people must see and understand. Secrecy is power and governments will do whatever they can to protect it. As Aaron himself suggested, this is a battle that will never be won, but can never be abandoned.\n\nSee this film.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Traile for The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi937277977", "name": "The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJjMDdjMmMtYTI2NC00ZTc4LWIxYmQtZmRjNDg2YmI1ZWYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzJjMDdjMmMtYTI2NC00ZTc4LWIxYmQtZmRjNDg2YmI1ZWYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-12-04T17:31:47Z"}, "url": "/title/tt3268458/", "EntryAdded": "2014-07-01"}
