That review's author uses terms like \"self- indulgent\" to describe this film.\n\nThat term is totally accurate. This movie is the definition of self-indulgence. A series of edited interviews is played while hand-drawn animations form and transform on the screen. That's the film. It sounds ridiculous.\n\nBut it drew me in and captivated me. The topics range from linguistic theory, Noam Chomsky's views on various things, and musings about his childhood. Gondry's own thoughts and interpretations, also included, seemed to miss the mark fairly often. But I felt like Gondry's voice ended up adding something to the movie. He is someone trying to understand complex concepts: sometimes he gets it, sometimes it doesn't seem like he does. From what I've written so far, this movie may sound like a nightmare to you.\n\nHowever, the whole concept was so original, and the drawings were engaging and interesting - - like a hand-drawn kaleidoscope with patterns that change depending on the topic being discussed. Gondry's thick french accent might distract some viewers, but I found it intelligible (there are also hand-drawn \"subtitles\" when he speaks, although I found them harder to read than I did to understand Gondry's accent). Chomsky has always struck me as a compelling speaker. He is soft-spoken but knows his lines (speaking figuratively) and makes his points well.\n\nAll in all a unique and surprisingly entertaining experience. 8/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H28M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2212276249", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUwMjE3MjgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU4NTU1MDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUwMjE3MjgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU4NTU1MDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A series of interviews featuring linguist, philosopher and activist Noam Chomsky done in hand-drawn animation.", "uploadDate": "2013-11-05T15:32:57Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1817287", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Is-the-Man-Who-Is-Tall-Happy-An-Animated-Conversation-with-Noam-Chomsky", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Is-the-Man-Who-Is-Tall-Happy-An-Animated-Conversation-with-Noam-Chomsky/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Is-the-Man-Who-Is-Tall-Happy-An-Animated-Conversation-with-Noam-Chomsky/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Is-the-Man-Who-Is-Tall-Happy-An-Animated-Conversation-with-Noam-Chomsky/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-11-09"}
