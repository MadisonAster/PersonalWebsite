Gondry interviews one of the leading authorities on human language and he cannot think of better questions to ask him than \"what makes you happy?\" or \"do you miss your dead wife?\".\n\nIf you're interested in Chomsky works, look somewhere else. If you happen to like Gondry - and want to maintain any respect for him - do yourself a favor and skip this movie.\n\nI understand some people appreciate Gondry lavish visual creativity (I usually do, too), but in this movie they cannot compensate for the fact the Gondry has no idea what his own movie is about (since he has no clue what Chomsky is talking about most of the time).", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3"}}, "duration": "PT1H28M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2212276249", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUwMjE3MjgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU4NTU1MDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUwMjE3MjgwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODU4NTU1MDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A series of interviews featuring linguist, philosopher and activist Noam Chomsky done in hand-drawn animation.", "uploadDate": "2013-11-05T15:32:57Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1817287", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Is-the-Man-Who-Is-Tall-Happy-An-Animated-Conversation-with-Noam-Chomsky", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Is-the-Man-Who-Is-Tall-Happy-An-Animated-Conversation-with-Noam-Chomsky/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Is-the-Man-Who-Is-Tall-Happy-An-Animated-Conversation-with-Noam-Chomsky/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Is-the-Man-Who-Is-Tall-Happy-An-Animated-Conversation-with-Noam-Chomsky/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Is-the-Man-Who-Is-Tall-Happy-An-Animated-Conversation-with-Noam-Chomsky/thumb.jpg"}
