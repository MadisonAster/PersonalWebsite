In short it was high grade (super-16) 16mm film transferred to BETACAM SP 3/4 inch video. It looked passable, though not quite professional enough to replace film with a video like medium.\n\nI bring this up because way back in the 80s I knew that as a film student that video would have to replace film because film, simply put, was too bulky and didn't deliver immediate results to tweak shots. There was too much down time involved in getting canisters off to the lab for dailies the next day. It was way too much work.\n\nFast forward 15 years and the first digital \"film\" cameras come out, and films like \"Star Wars the Phantom Menace\" and the feature film of \"The Wild Wild West\" hit the screens using SONY's new digital camera technology. It had to happen. Even in the 70s and 60s you knew that the electronic medium needed to replace the bulky and expensive film technology at some point, no matter how good a filmic image was (or is).\n\nKeannu Reeves explores the revolution that's taken place in the last 15 years, and still continues to take place to this day of the old tried and true 35mm camera verse the more versatile and less expensive (and less care intensive and attention needing) 35mm film cameras.\n\nOpinions from film makers young and old alike, famous and not-so- famous are interviewed for their opinions on \"film\" technology, and how the advent of digital technology has revamped commercial film making.\n\nThe documentary is three years old as of this writing, and even when it was produced the arguments of film verse digital were already getting stale, and may seem a bit tired by the time anyone who reads my review (and who's never seen the doc). But the issues should prove interesting to anyone who's spent any time behind the camera.\n\nReeves produces a very interesting documentary on the short comings of the evolving medium, and keeps it strictly a matter of technology and presentation of content as the focus of this documentary.\n\nTo encapsulate; not only is digital technology more versatile, but it is simply better all around; the images are sharper, the medium is easier to manipulate in terms of both editing and other post work, and doesn't require that massive support apparatus that something like an Arri BLIII or Panaflex 35 require. Actual film offers a chemical representation of images, which, when projected at 24 or 25fps, deliver a moving image that closely approximates your eyes passive information intake mode. Digital cameras have finally been able to slow down their shutter speeds and record and deliver an image that approximates the same effect. As of this writing a 35mm or 65mm negative can still retain more information than a CDC, but it's only a matter of time before electronic image capture surpasses the photochemical process.\n\nAgain, Reeves documentary explains all, and does so with more interest than my review can give.\n\nIf you're an amateur or professional, and haven't seen it, check it out."}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3788088601", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MzQxMzM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQxMjQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MzQxMzM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQxMjQzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The documentary investigates the history, process and workflow of both digital and photochemical film creation.", "uploadDate": "2012-08-22T15:51:00Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2014338", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Side-by-Side", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Side-by-Side/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Side-by-Side/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Side-by-Side/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Side-by-Side/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-03-03"}
