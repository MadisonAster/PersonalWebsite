We get to see strong proponents for both formats, each presenting very valid arguments when it comes to the benefits & limitations of both film stock & digital recording in things like ease of use, economy, flexibility etc.\n\nOn an overall scale, Side by Side beautifully covers the still ongoing battle of the superior format in the film industry today and my only gripe with it is that it's only 98 minutes long. Even though in my opinion digital cinema seems to be a valid choice in the long run, IMAX has given film stocks a fresh breathe of life, and if only both formats can mutually co-exist then it's a win-win situation for the industry. Extremely gripping, highly entertaining & downright informative, Side by Side is a must-watch for every cinema fan out there."}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Version", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3788088601", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MzQxMzM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQxMjQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MzQxMzM2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDQxMjQzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The documentary investigates the history, process and workflow of both digital and photochemical film creation.", "uploadDate": "2012-08-22T15:51:00Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2014338", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Side-by-Side", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Side-by-Side/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Side-by-Side/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Side-by-Side/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Side-by-Side/thumb.jpg"}
