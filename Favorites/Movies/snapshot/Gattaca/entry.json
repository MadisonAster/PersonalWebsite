It became critically ignored, which I can not understand at all. The themes of this movie-of superiority/inferiority, of identity, of destiny, they're all there. For those of you that haven't seen this movie, it is about a eutopian society where the highest ranks work at a space program named Gattaca. Vincent (Ethan Hawke) has wanted to work there since he was a child, but since his parents did not \"pre-order\" him, he was born inferior (a 99 % chance of heart failure by the age of 30, physical and mental problems, etc. ) to his \"ordered\" brother Antoine. Vincent has always seen something in a rival in his brother, because his brother is their dad's favorite, and he seems to have everything going for him. Vincent's job is as a janitor at Gattaca, with the hope that he will get in some day, but all the have to do is get a fingerprint of Vincent's, or a blood sample, or anything, and they know all about him, his profile, his life expectancy, etc. No one will hire Vincent because he is so liable to damage. One day, though, he hires someone to turn his identity into Eugene's, (Jude Law) an olympic-swimming, high potential winner who has everything you would need to get anywhere-except he comes back from a trip a paralyzed cripple from the waist down. So Vincent makes a deal with Eugene-Vincent gets Eugene's identity if Vincent pays the rent and gives him a companion. Everything works to plan, and Vincent borrows Eugene's fingerprints, blood samples, haircut, even urine samples. He even meets Irene (Uma Thurman) a sexy female worker at Gattaca who takes a shine to Vincent (who she thinks is Eugene). Until one day......\n\nGattaca is a great visual movie (it was nominated for the best art direction oscar but lost to Titanic), rides strong on very good performances by Ethan Hawke and Jude Law, and is definitely worth seeing.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H46M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Gattaca", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2611282201", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDUwOGM2ZjMtMDFlNi00N2M1LWFiZjYtNGRhYzkyNWFlMTI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDUwOGM2ZjMtMDFlNi00N2M1LWFiZjYtNGRhYzkyNWFlMTI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:01:38Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Gattaca", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Gattaca/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Gattaca/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Gattaca/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
