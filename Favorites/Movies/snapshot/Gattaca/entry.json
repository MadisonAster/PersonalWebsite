This is most certainly one of the best films of all time. Script is wonderful, cinematography brilliant, Actors perform to a T, and the underlying message is one that all mankind should take to heart, for this great movie about human perseverance and will, and how real a situation in the world like this could be. 10 out of 10 bottom line. If you don't see this movie you will be committing a crime against yourself. Also the relationship between Vincent and Gerome and his brother is brought together perfectly and well developed. For that matter all of the characters in this film bring a little something different to the table that you will see very rarely in any film.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H46M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Gattaca", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2611282201", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDUwOGM2ZjMtMDFlNi00N2M1LWFiZjYtNGRhYzkyNWFlMTI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDUwOGM2ZjMtMDFlNi00N2M1LWFiZjYtNGRhYzkyNWFlMTI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:01:38Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119177", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Gattaca", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Gattaca/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Gattaca/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Gattaca/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Gattaca/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
