He said, \"No, it's not a comedy, well...not exactly.\"  I didn't quite understand until I watched it myself.  Truman takes on a tone quite different than any parody/comedies I've seen lately.  The point (the media and its destructive powers)  is subtlely relayed through dark humor, and you don't feel like the director is smashing you over the head with his morals.  Peter Weir demonstrated his artistic genius in Dead Poets Society and here as well. The soundtrack is great, Ed Harris is stellar (what were they THINKING at the Academy?) and for once I actually liked Jim Carrey. His performance wasn't ribald for once. The final scene--I will not reveal it--is a majestic, long-awaited finish to an intellectual movie. Some people will insist that it was boring or pointless.  Those are the same viewers who prefer slapstick, obvious humor to the subtle layers presented here.  This is a thinking person's movie.  If you can't see the underlying message here, of course you won't like it!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H43M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Truman Show", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1878327577", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc5MGY5MTctNDE3OS00OWQ4LWFhYWQtNDc0NTBmYjFiNDM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc5MGY5MTctNDE3OS00OWQ4LWFhYWQtNDc0NTBmYjFiNDM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Paramount", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:52:43Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Truman-Show", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Truman-Show/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Truman-Show/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Truman-Show/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Truman-Show/thumb.jpg"}
