By refusing to accept the junk science about junk food, Naughton effectively and entertainingly digs up the skinny on fat and how folks get that way.\n\nI had a lot of similar dieting experiences as the ones he relates to in the film, and my own research discovered a lot of what is revealed in Fat Head (the cooked data behind the Lipid Theory, the methodological flaws in the CDC Obesity report, etc.). But whereas I'm a lazy bastard who was content to learn that no, my body's NOT broken (but rather the Expert Ideas on how it should work are), Naughton went the extra mile and got health professionals and scientists to state on the record just why everything you think you know about fat and nutrition is wrong.\n\nHe never strays into the waters of conspiracy theory but hints at what COULD be the reason so many health professionals pushed a flawed agenda for so long.\n\nAs another user noted, the production values are not ILM-standard. So what? This film is all about the information and the manner in which it's presented is less important than what it's presenting. I suggest if you're really pressed for high quality funny animation, you throw on a Bakshi DVD and watch that. If you want animation that clearly and concisely conveys information, then the animation in Fat Head will do ya just fine.\n\nI'm sure a lot of folks will NOT be happy with the info in this film. My question is, are they angry because it's wrong and harmful (and the evidence suggests it's not) or because it dares question the tribal notions of Fat and Sugar BAD!? I suspect option number two and bruised egos will do more to stir up their wrath than any problems with the information in Fat Head.\n\nWell, that's their problem. Let 'em wallow in the horrors of Crap Veganism while the rest of us eat what nature programmed us to eat. I'm an omnivore and damned proud of it! Now if you'll excuse me, I'm up a for a nice brisk walk to KFC for a three-piece meal of Original Recipe...", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1333994", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fat-Head", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fat-Head/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fat-Head/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fat-Head/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fat-Head/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
