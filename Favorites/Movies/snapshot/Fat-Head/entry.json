Tom, leave the comedy to the pros. It would have been a much more enjoyable viewing/learning experience had it just been straight forward the entire way through. A must watch for excellent information on nutrition and how easily government and other fields can go astray. \n\nThis film came out in 2009 and the information in it did not hit the mainstream until around 2014 or so. In my observations there is no other field in the world as fraught with misinformation as nutrition. Most people just seem to make things up and/or adopt ideas that suit their image. Very little is understood about nutrition, but this movie takes a very scientific and un-opinionated approach. I appreciated that, a rare trait in a documentary now days."}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1333994", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fat-Head", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fat-Head/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fat-Head/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fat-Head/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
