The first 20 minutes are a nice set up of family discord and inferiority, then the thriller starts, and gradually gets more and more paranoid, like a less fluffy version of the long forgotten Hugh Grant/Gene Hackman movie 'Extreme Measures'. Sam Worthington does nice work as a broken human being, it's only just over 90mins which is perfect and feels just like a midweek trip to Blockbusters. A nice surprise on a rainy day.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2560147225", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM3Y2Y3OWMtNThlNC00YWVlLTk1MmQtMWU3ZGY0ZjQ2YTRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM3Y2Y3OWMtNThlNC00YWVlLTk1MmQtMWU3ZGY0ZjQ2YTRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Driving home after a tense holiday weekend with his in-laws, Ray Monroe (Sam Worthington) pulls into a rest area with his wife Joanne (Lily Rabe) and daughter Peri (Lucy Capri).
