The cast is incredible, the acting is incredible, the story is also incredible.  I wish that this had been released on dvd, I would be first in line to purchase it. It is basically the story of how Apple Computers grew, and how Microsoft grew, they met up, and Microsoft took over.  Im not sure how historically accurate this is, however I do know the basic jist is correct.  The real life \"Woz\" validated on his website the correctness of this movie.  He also said that the way people are portrayed is how they were.  Noah Wyle is excellent as a heartless and cruel Steve Jobs.  Anthony Michael Hall is equally great as a geeky Bill Gates. I hope TNT replays it at some point in time, in case it does, RECORD it.  I believe its also available for rent.  SEE THIS MOVIE."}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Pirates of Silicon Valley", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1521418521", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGViMjFjODEtNzExYy00YjkwLWEzNGUtZWYzNGM5OWU0ZWE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGViMjFjODEtNzExYy00YjkwLWEzNGUtZWYzNGM5OWU0ZWE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from TBS", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:35:21Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168122", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pirates-of-Silicon-Valley", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pirates-of-Silicon-Valley/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pirates-of-Silicon-Valley/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pirates-of-Silicon-Valley/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pirates-of-Silicon-Valley/thumb.jpg"}
