The makers of this movie seemed to agree with its protagonists that the evolution of the personal computer is a process that shaped the history of the world - and they're right. If you're not sitting in front of a Windows box or Mac right now, you're in the vast minority. The story of how Steve Jobs and Bill Gates amassed such wealth and power is an interesting one.\n\nNoah Wyle (Jobs) and Anthony Michael Hall (Gates) fit their characters to a T. Gates was portrayed just as I imagined him - smug, opportunistic and sneaky, but hardly villainous. Surprisingly, during this movie I was more sympathetic to Gates than to the brilliant but unstable Jobs who came across as arrogant and petulant.\n\nAll in all, this was quite enjoyable for a tele-movie. If you're inclined towards the geeky yourself, and remember the early days of the PC biz, you'll probably find this movie quite educational.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H35M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Pirates of Silicon Valley", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1521418521", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGViMjFjODEtNzExYy00YjkwLWEzNGUtZWYzNGM5OWU0ZWE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGViMjFjODEtNzExYy00YjkwLWEzNGUtZWYzNGM5OWU0ZWE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from TBS", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:35:21Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0168122", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pirates-of-Silicon-Valley", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pirates-of-Silicon-Valley/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pirates-of-Silicon-Valley/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pirates-of-Silicon-Valley/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pirates-of-Silicon-Valley/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-07-05"}
