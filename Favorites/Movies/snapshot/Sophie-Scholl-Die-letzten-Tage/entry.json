I've just been to a preview of Sophie Scholl in Manchester, England; and I am not only glad that this movie has been made, but also that it is done at the time when young people are happier to do 'whatever' rather than have any principles.\n\nThere is no point debating historical accuracy. As it followed from the Q&A session with Marc Rothemund following the preview, not only the filming took place at the original locations that are still there, but the crew went at great length doing things 'right', including getting the weather reports for February 1943. Yes, there is this strange feeling of looking at the film's title, which sounds like the title for a documentary. But then I didn't gather the impression that Rothemund's goal was to poeticise the story of Sophie Scholl. I think it is quite enough that in Germany she is perceived as a martyr. What Sophie Scholl - Die Letzten Tage does successfully is it shows a person behind the image, a young girl (younger than myself), who was prepared to die for her idea, but desperately loved life.\n\nI read critical comments, and mine was in part sparked by them. Far from trying to debate their correctness, I'll do exactly what I always do on these occasions. Guys, those of you who decide to write next dismissive drag, instead tell us how you would direct in Rothemund's place. Or how would you act in place of Julia Jentsch? If you have really valid suggestions, we'll all be happy to hear.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Sophie Scholl: The Final Days", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3565748505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmI1MTliNzYtN2IyNC00ZjMxLWExODQtMTg1MDAyMjg2NmI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmI1MTliNzYtN2IyNC00ZjMxLWExODQtMTg1MDAyMjg2NmI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Zeitgeist Films", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:12:13Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426578", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sophie-Scholl-Die-letzten-Tage", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sophie-Scholl-Die-letzten-Tage/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sophie-Scholl-Die-letzten-Tage/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sophie-Scholl-Die-letzten-Tage/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sophie-Scholl-Die-letzten-Tage/thumb.jpg"}
