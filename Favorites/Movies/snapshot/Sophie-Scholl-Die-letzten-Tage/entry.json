This movie is absolutely not like \"the Downfall\" (Der Untergang). Sophie Scholl is way more demanding and exacting. Now, 3 days after I've seen this movie, I still got a feeling of guilt and concernment in my stomach. In my opinion Sophie Scholl is due to its precision more like a (replayed) documentary movie than a Drama, which makes it even more \"shocking\". This is for sure no light entertainment, and those, that don't like long conversations or even are not interested in history, should not watch this movie. This is the main reason, why Sophie Scholl won't make the transatlantic heap, because it's too \"special\". It's a part of German history and requires a willingness to cope with it.\n\nMarc Rothemund does a very good job on directing this movie, and Julia Jentsch is very convincing. While watching this movie you don't have the feeling that the story is 60 years ago and can't touch you. It makes you feel like you're in the thick of it. And that's why I give a 9/10. Great Movie.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Sophie Scholl: The Final Days", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3565748505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmI1MTliNzYtN2IyNC00ZjMxLWExODQtMTg1MDAyMjg2NmI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmI1MTliNzYtN2IyNC00ZjMxLWExODQtMTg1MDAyMjg2NmI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Zeitgeist Films", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:12:13Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426578", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sophie-Scholl-Die-letzten-Tage", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sophie-Scholl-Die-letzten-Tage/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sophie-Scholl-Die-letzten-Tage/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sophie-Scholl-Die-letzten-Tage/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sophie-Scholl-Die-letzten-Tage/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-06-30"}
