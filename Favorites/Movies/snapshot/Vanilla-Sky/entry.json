He believes it is because of his face.The movie actually takes a turn as a brain teaser,post accident, not explaining things very clearly just like a weird dream. The ending could have been much better as it gives only a glimpse of what actually happened.It took the movie to where it started leaving many questions unanswered.Anyway it is worth a watch....", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H16M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259711", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Vanilla-Sky", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Vanilla-Sky/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Vanilla-Sky/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Vanilla-Sky/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Vanilla-Sky/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
