Tom Cruise plays a young man who was handed everything in his life. He takes things for granted and it comes around full swing in this great movie with a superb twist. This film will keep you engaged in the plot and unable to pause it to take a bathroom break.\n\nIts a movie that really makes you step back and look at your life and how you live it. You cannot really appreciate the better things in life (the sweet), like love, until you have experienced the bad (the sour). The theme will really get you to \"open your eyes\".\n\nOnly complaint is that the movie gets very twisted at points and is hard to really understand. I think the end is perfect though. I recommend you watch it and see for yourself.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H16M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0259711", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Vanilla-Sky", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Vanilla-Sky/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Vanilla-Sky/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Vanilla-Sky/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Vanilla-Sky/thumb.jpg"}
