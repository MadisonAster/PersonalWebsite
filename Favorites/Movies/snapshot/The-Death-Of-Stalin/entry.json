And its treatment of the Stalin Era of the Soviet Union is both darkly humorous and actually very unflinching in its depicting the monsters and their monstrosities for what they were.\n\nI was worried that, in an attempt to extract humor from the situation that they might've glossed over just how monstrous the key characters actually were. To Iannucci and Schneider's credit however, there was absolutely no glossing over at all. Beria, for instance, is portrayed as every bit the monster in human form that he was - this, even as that portrayal is also made darkly and delightfully humorous at times.\n\nThe whole cast played their parts well and played them \"straight\" - which only heightened the humor and the horror of what life was like under Stalin in the Soviet Union. Even the nominal \"hero\" of the tale, Nakita Khrushchev, is realistically portrayed as being just as conniving and callous and power hungry as everyone else. Buscemi would seem an odd choice for that particular role but he pulls it off with style and excellence. So too does Simon Russell Beale in his portrayal of Beria. \n\nThis is a nicely done film with excellent production values, a great script, fine acting, excellent pacing, and a compelling tale that is well told.\n\nI highly recommend it!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1778169881", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzNjYWE2OWUtNWE5Zi00MGFkLTkxNmUtM2JjOGI4MWUzYTBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzNjYWE2OWUtNWE5Zi00MGFkLTkxNmUtM2JjOGI4MWUzYTBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In the days following Stalin's collapse, his core team of ministers tussle for control; some want positive change in the Soviet Union, others have more sinister motives.
