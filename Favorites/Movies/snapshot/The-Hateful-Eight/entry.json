Ignore the haters. Tarantino entertainment to the core!", "reviewBody": "This is a short review I am forced to write after noticing the critics and the haters. Hateful Eight is another Tarantino masterpiece. It may be similar to his previous movies, but great directors don't come often and in a single life they can make only so many films. Now if Tarantino decides to make another 'Tanrantino' western with all the fine work thrown in as in his other films, I am no one no complain. This guy is a legend and I am privileged to see the handful of movies he will make in his lifetime. Even if he makes similar movies a dozen times, I would still watch it, cause this guy knows filmmaking at its finest. Hateful Eight is a blizzard of fine acting, fine dialogue, humor, darkness, snow and that incredible eye for perfection and storytelling. \n\nGo damn watch it and be prepared to be a told a western story Tarantino style.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H48M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Teaser", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2079306521", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4MjQ3MzgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDcwMDM1NjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4MjQ3MzgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDcwMDM1NjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In post-Civil War Wyoming, bounty hunters try to find shelter during a blizzard but get involved in a plot of betrayal and deception.
