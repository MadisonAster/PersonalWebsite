                          'am too often put off by modern entries into the '
                          'genre that try to replace atmosphere and '
                          'intelligence by just having nudity and swearing; '
                          'the genre managed atmosphere without these in the '
                          'forties and fifties but yet modern films seem to '
                          'rely on them. With Chinatown however, everything '

                          'genre and, as such, is very well set in the period '
                          'and is of suitable presentation even if the '
                          'material and tone is darker and harder than would '
                          'have been allowed years ago. This is not to say it '
                          'is just a copy and paste from better films because '
                          "it isn't and indeed stands out as one of the best "
                          'detective noirs I have seen in ages. The plot is '
                          'always going to be the most important thing and it '
                          'gets it spot on throughout, doing the proper thing '
                          'of starting with a simple story and continually '
                          'building it more and more complex as it goes. '

                          'the credits prevent us from seeing. Director '
                          'Polanski does a great job of putting this story in '

                          'darkness coming through subtly throughout the '
                          'movie. Of course it helps that he also has a great '
                          'cast to work with. Jack Nicholson is iconic in this '
                          'role and, if I had to pick one film to act as an '
                          'introduction to Nicholson then it would be this '
                          'one. He is tough yet damaged, upright but seedy and '
                          'he brings out his complex character well. Dunaway '
                          'has less screen time but is just as impressive with '
                          'a similarly dark role. Huston adds class and '
                          'manages to ooze menace while also coming across as '
                          'a harmless old man. The support cast are all fine '
                          'but really the film belongs to these three, with '
                          'Nicholson being the stand out role.\n'
                          '\n'
                          'Overall this is a very classy film that has stood '
                          'up very well to become a well-deserved classic. The '
                          'story is complex, mysterious yet simple to follow; '
                          'it is dark and seedy without relying on swearing or '
                          'nudity to set the atmosphere. The direction is '
