Telling his story almost violently out of sequence, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu makes no apology for presenting information in a manner that is often abrupt and/or confusing.  His choice to juxtapose a myriad of images to reveal the complexities and subtleties of the characters challenges the viewer even as it elevates the story.\n\n Each of the three main characters faces a series of crises that unfold in the fullness of I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's version of time.  By so carefully painting characters' surroundings along with their reactions to the events that change their lives, lead characters are stripped to the bone.  The supporting cast is nothing short of miraculous (notably Clea Duvall, Charlotte Gainsborg and Melissa Leo) and completes a wonderfully complex series of portraits of the three main characters.\n\nLike few films in recent memory, 21 Grams fully reveals what it is to be human in the clutches of life's most challenging moments."}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "21 Grams", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3383951641", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRkMjI3N2YtZTdjZi00YzM3LTg4MDAtOGFhOTA5ZDE1NWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRkMjI3N2YtZTdjZi00YzM3LTg4MDAtOGFhOTA5ZDE1NWMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T02:56:31Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0315733", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/21-Grams", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/21-Grams/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/21-Grams/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/21-Grams/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
