Watching this film, one can tell from the subdued effects, grainy black-and-white filter, and guerrilla-style filmmaking that this must be a low-budget independent film - NOT to try and downplay its impact, as many independent films can clearly surpass any typical Hollywood movie, in terms of style and subject matter.\n\n\"Pi\" is a perfectly concrete example of how the relative absence of special effects, explosions, etc. can still help create an engaging, and thoroughly unique viewing experience. Overflowing with intensity and hyperkinetic camerawork, this is a frightening roller-coaster ride of a film; despite clocking in at less than 90 minutes, \"Pi\" is by no means short on resonance - but rather leaves a heavy feeling of exuberance and fascination with the material that lasts long after it's finished. At the same time, though, people who aren't as open-minded to more obscure, abstract films like this would be, I think, surprised. This is not as complicated or bewildering a film as I had expected. If one can be able to focus intently on the story, the result is rewarding, and doesn't provide for much head-scratching. Its style seems rather modern, rather hip...at times it reminded me of \"The Matrix\" (which, ironically, was released the FOLLOWING year) what with its slick techno musical score and its flashy opening credits.\n\nTo shy away from this film simply because of its math content is to be completely shallow and ignorant. The way it handles the material is a whole lot more interesting than you'd probably think. Like \"A Beautiful Mind\", \"Pi\" is an instant classic that serves to re-awaken my erratic interests in my poorest subject, mathematics. It's original, it's interesting, and above all - genius."}, "duration": "PT1H24M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Pi", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1904214297", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTZkNWU3YjgtZTg4Ni00MzA1LThkODItZDMyZmNkODlmOWYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTZkNWU3YjgtZTg4Ni00MzA1LThkODItZDMyZmNkODlmOWYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Artisan", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:39:28Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0138704", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pi", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pi/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pi/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pi/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pi/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
