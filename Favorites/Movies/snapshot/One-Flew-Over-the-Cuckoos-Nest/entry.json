Just think about Larry Flynt in \"The People vs. Larry Flynt\" or Andy Kaufman in \"Man on the Moon\", in the two most recent movies of Forman. The central character in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" played by Jack Nicholson is also one of those characters, that wants to break the routine and even starts a revolt against the staff and nurse Ratchett in particular, in a mental institution.\n\nThe movie is perhaps more comedy and entertainment than heavy drama. Still that doesn't mean that the movie isn't filled with some powerful emotional sequences. The tension between the patients and the staff gets more and more notable and grows throughout the movie, which eventually leads to a 'wonderful' ending which I'm not going to spoil.\n\nYes, Jack Nicholson is truly splendid in his role and it seemed like he was improvising all his lines and actions during the entire movie. It was a really Oscar worthy performances, which he also received. Another Oscar winner for her performance was Louise Fletcher, which in my opinion is a bit too much credit. She plays her role well but nothing more than that. She did not deeply impressed me or anything. This movie also marks the debut for some today well known actors such as Danny DeVito (he looked so young and different!), Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif, who also received an Oscar nomination.\n\nReally one of those movies that you must have seen at least once in your life.\n\n9/10\n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "A criminal pleads insanity after getting into trouble again and once in the mental institution rebels against the oppressive nurse and rallies up the scared patients.", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3943282969", "name": "Trailer", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2NhZWYwOWEtNmRjMC00YTVjLWIxZjYtNWY2OGIwZTM5OTdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2NhZWYwOWEtNmRjMC00YTVjLWIxZjYtNWY2OGIwZTM5OTdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2017-09-08T01:58:01Z"}, "url": "/title/tt0073486/", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
