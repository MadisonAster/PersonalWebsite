Acting was superb, but content makes me sick. I give this a 1 on storyline alone. Ray Kroc was a scumbag of the highest order, in a class all his own. My heart breaks for the McDonald Brothers who were steamrolled, manipulated, and who had their livelihood utterly destroyed by this cunning, ruthless, and I'm convinced, sociopathic man. Especially with the notes at the end how they never received one dime in royalties. This story will really make you hate McDonald's.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H55M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "New Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1128052249", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5Mzg4NDg5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTkwNDEwMTI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5Mzg4NDg5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTkwNDEwMTI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Ray Kroc, a struggling salesman from Illinois, meets Mac and Dick McDonald, co-operators of a burger restaurant in 1950s Southern California.", "uploadDate": "2017-01-04T04:28:04Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4276820", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Founder", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Founder/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Founder/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Founder/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Founder/thumb.jpg"}
