But it does produce a few wonderful - and hilarious - surprises that make it a very enjoyable 90 minutes.\n\nOne is Anna Farris, who does a great twist on the archetypal dizzy blonde beloved of Hollywood since time immemorial.\n\nBut the real kickers are the jarring one-liners that pepper an otherwise sweet and predictable film. Several reduced this viewer to paroxysms of laughter, tears rolling down cheeks, beverage spurting across the room.\n\nThese moments, when they arrive, are so unexpected that the effect is one of firmly-flicked kipper on unprotected jowl. And none are in the \"gross-out\" style that one might have expected in a film of this genre.\n\nVery bunny indeed.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The House Bunny", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1305281305", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAxYzc3ODQtMGZmMy00ZWVjLTlkODItYzBkNzVlMzE1NzFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAxYzc3ODQtMGZmMy00ZWVjLTlkODItYzBkNzVlMzE1NzFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A romantic comedy film, directed by Fred Wolf", "uploadDate": "2009-01-23T07:42:27Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0852713", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-House-Bunny", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-House-Bunny/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-House-Bunny/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-House-Bunny/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-House-Bunny/thumb.jpg"}
