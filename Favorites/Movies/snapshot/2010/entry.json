The comments I saw for a review saying it was boring as the original (first one) and ...\"uninvolving\"? This movie blew me away, I really thought it was great. This is NOT an action movie and for that matter neither was \"2001\". If you're looking for a fast paced and, well.. shallow movie this isn't that either. You thinkers, this movie is for you. The acting is wonderful and special effects are very convincing and not diverting. The story is very interesting although it certainly dates it more than special effects. I can probably name about 120 sci-fi movies that aren't as enjoyable to me as 2010 and most of those are still more than worth seeing. Not only worth seeing but for genre fans it is worth owning on DVD.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H56M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086837", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/2010", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/2010/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/2010/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/2010/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-09-12"}
