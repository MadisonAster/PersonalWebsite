To such people, Kubrick was a genius. Kubrick made 2001. 2001 is a *Kubrick* story. Therefore 2010 is by definition a presumptuous attempt to explain what Kubrick deliberately left unsaid. etc. etc.\n\nSorry, 2001 is an *Arthur C Clarke* story. He wrote a sequel to his own story, called it \"2010\" and *he* explained what Kubrick left unsaid. I'd say he had a right. Then someone buys the film rights and produces a fine movie from it.\n\nAnd it *is* a fine movie. Intelligence far in excess of the usual Hollywood SciFi garbage (Independence Day or Starship Troopers anyone?).\n\nThe scenes with Keir Dullea were far more chilling than anything in the original.\n\nArteur theory is still alive and well, I see."}, "duration": "PT1H56M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086837", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/2010", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/2010/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/2010/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/2010/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/2010/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-09-12"}
