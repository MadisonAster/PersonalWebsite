A delightful, educational watch.", "reviewBody": "The deliberate pace of this movie might not be to the taste of all viewers, but I found it riveting. It is a fascinating chapter of the history of Portland, Oregon (in fact the history of the entire Northwest) that has been brought back to life in an unforgettable way.\n\nThe mix of current interviews of actual participants, contemporary interviews, news reels clips and professional editing cement the documentation. Truly Oscar worthy.\n\nYou don't have to even LIKE baseball to sink yourself into this story. It will carry you. However, if you like the sport, if you have ever watched \"Bonanza\", ever heard of Lefty Gomez or know who Snake Plisskin is, you're in for a treat.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H20M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3445270", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Battered-Bastards-Of-Baseball", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Battered-Bastards-Of-Baseball/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Battered-Bastards-Of-Baseball/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Battered-Bastards-Of-Baseball/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Battered-Bastards-Of-Baseball/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
