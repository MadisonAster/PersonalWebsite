I remember a left-handed catcher from Vancouver WA, an older guy that was also a catcher I don't think he made the team rather he wasn't half bad but I think his age was against him. The game frank the Flake Peters played all nine positions I think he pitched the 8 inning and threw 9 pitches and retired the side all nine pitches were knuckle balls. One day in tryouts there was a kid from Spokane WA and he got hurt his shoulder and they ask if I would take him to the hospital I took him and when I went back the next day he left during the night They had no insurance and he didn't have any. They were a fun bunch to watch. At the time Frank Peters was the first to steal first base. He just picked it up and left the park."}, "url": "/title/tt3445270/"}
