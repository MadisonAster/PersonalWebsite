It's about Bing Russell (father of Kurt Russell) and his ownership of the minor league ball club, the Portland Mavericks. But, unlike most other teams, his team was not affiliated with a major league team but was an independent that scraped together players rejected by other teams. And, what shocked the league was that the team was SUPER-successful and set attendance records...and won a lot of games. But, this rag-tag group of castoffs also irritated the powers that be because they had attitude and didn't play the game exactly like the rest. What's next? See the film.\n\nAside from some music that was too repetitive, the film was amazingly well made--especially since it was made for Netflix. You just don't expect this sort of thing being made for this DVD service!! But, it's well done and will be of interest to everyone--even those who couldn't care less about sports. Worth seeing.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H20M", "Title": "The Battered Bastards of Baseball", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3445270", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Battered-Bastards-Of-Baseball", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Battered-Bastards-Of-Baseball/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Battered-Bastards-Of-Baseball/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Battered-Bastards-Of-Baseball/entry.json"}
