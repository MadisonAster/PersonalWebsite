I remember a left-handed catcher from Vancouver WA, an older guy that was also a catcher I don't think he made the team rather he wasn't half bad but I think his age was against him. The game frank the Flake Peters played all nine positions I think he pitched the 8 inning and threw 9 pitches and retired the side all nine pitches were knuckle balls. One day in tryouts there was a kid from Spokane WA and he got hurt his shoulder and they ask if I would take him to the hospital I took him and when I went back the next day he left during the night They had no insurance and he didn't have any. They were a fun bunch to watch. At the time Frank Peters was the first to steal first base. He just picked it up and left the park."}, "duration": "PT1H20M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3445270", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Battered-Bastards-Of-Baseball", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Battered-Bastards-Of-Baseball/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Battered-Bastards-Of-Baseball/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Battered-Bastards-Of-Baseball/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Battered-Bastards-Of-Baseball/thumb.jpg"}
