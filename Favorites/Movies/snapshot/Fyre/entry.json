I feel sorry for the honest minority who were robbed of their hard-earned wages and their livelihood.\n\nThat is the extent of my sorrow. It's hard to feel sorry for the upper class who think nothing of paying thousands of dollars for a weekend of debauchery. For a short time, they got to see first hand how the 'little people' live; no shelter, no food, no sanitation.\n\nHearing a socialite complain that the jet trip to the Bahamas was like 'riding in economy class' sums it up. And Billy McFarland will no doubt be back to prey on the wealthy again.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H37M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2433858073", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGI0N2FkZTMtZGE0Ni00MDYxLTliODctOWVmNDkyNDU3ODQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGI0N2FkZTMtZGE0Ni00MDYxLTliODctOWVmNDkyNDU3ODQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An exclusive behind the scenes look at the infamous unraveling of the Fyre music festival.", "uploadDate": "2019-01-10T19:03:04Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9412098", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fyre", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fyre/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fyre/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fyre/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Fyre/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
