I'm \"a poor white with guns\" and you don't see me getting triggered because my group were made fun of. He made fun of everything - as he should be able to.\n\nThe last time I was so amazed and laughing so hard at an open comedian like this Patrice O'Neal was alive..."}, "Title": "Dave Chappelle: Sticks & Stones", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10810424", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dave-Chappelle-Sticks--Stones", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dave-Chappelle-Sticks--Stones/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dave-Chappelle-Sticks--Stones/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dave-Chappelle-Sticks--Stones/entry.json"}
