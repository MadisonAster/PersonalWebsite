                          'I watched it as a standalone film. As such the film '
                          'is very much about the superficial aspects as it '
                          'tells a story about a woman being held while an '

                          'The film opens with the striking image of a woman '
                          'on a table and in a very nicely done set, has a '
                          'tense standoff between the two. It is very well '

                          'still had plenty to offer. Although it is all very '
                          'much about the surface level qualities, the film '
                          'makes this work because it does these very well '
