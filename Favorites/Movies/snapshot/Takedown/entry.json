Great pains are taken to portray Kevin Mitnick as a temper-prone, reactionary, asocial neurotic, with nuances of sexual dysfunctionality thrown in as well. Whereas, the hero (Tsutomu Shimomura)comes off as being the shiniest star in the sky.\n\nI would say this general portrayal is unfair, and nearly propagandistic in its intent. The movie really becomes a base for expounding the moral issues of hacking and 'freedom of information' in a society that survives on security. It is a clear warning, and it does NOT favor hacking or hackers.\n\nI am appalled by that, because a more open picture of both sides might have been painted. \"Hackers\" brought the world to the standards of today, and daily test the security and limits of it... likewise, \"programmers\" continue to strive for safety, but also encrypt for greed, control, power, and politics. It is not all back and white.\n\nEither a hacker OR a programmer are capable of accidentally, or intentionally creating havoc in a real world of banking, traffic lights, airports, and defense systems, although the chances seem less with programmers (unless you know about \"The Singularity\").\n\nAll I am saying is that this movie is VERY biased against hackers, it allows them NO redeemable social attributes, and it radically stereotypes them. It is intended to PERSUADE you. THAT, I regard as a THREAT to my own individual freedom of thought, and when you cross that line... alarms go off.\n\nBEWARE of this if you haven't seen this movie yet.\n\nDid \"Big Brother\" produce this film? (\"Big Brother\" is a reference to George Orwell's novel \"1984\") Regardless, the movie has good detail within a fast-moving and captivating plot.\n\nLastly, NO, I am NOT pro-hacker oriented. Mitnick is clearly a criminal with a long record of convictions dating all the way back to 1981... but, I don't like being told what, or how, to think about a whole class of people.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5", "worstRating": "1"}}, "url": "/title/tt0159784/"}
