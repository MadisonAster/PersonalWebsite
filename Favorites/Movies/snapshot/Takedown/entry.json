Which is all you could ever ask for in a movie. :-)\n\nJohnny Depp lookalike Skeet Ulrich, Russell Wong, Donal Logue, Cara Buono, Amanda Peet and Angela Featherstone make this low budget movie worth while.\n\nWhether or not the real Kevin Mitnick is a nice fellow or what he did was totally legal doesn't detract much from this ripping yarn. The production values are ok (but what would you expect from a guy who spends most of his time sitting behind a monitor in a small room?), however, the concept makes it more than worth while. Especially the \"social engineering\" segments are cool. Not to be missed if you're at all interested in movies about sub-cultures and the guerilla mentality.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159784", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Takedown", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Takedown/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Takedown/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Takedown/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-06-29"}
