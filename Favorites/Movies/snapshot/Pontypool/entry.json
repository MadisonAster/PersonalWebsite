However, it does feature some refreshingly new twists and turns to the classical zombie-infestation-overflows-a-village horror story. These new twists and differences are beautifully explained during the movie, and won't leave you with any questions at the end, something that doesn't happen often enough in this genre. \n\nThe acting by Stephen McHattie and Lisa Houle is decent enough, especially for a horror movie. Especially the first part of the movie, where the tension is built up, relies for the most part on their acting and they pull it off nicely. The camera-work is good but nothing special, the setting is dark but what can you expect from this genre of film!\n\nAll in all, I believe Pontypool stands out of the bulk of today's horror movies. It won't make it to be an all time classic of the genre, but it's a nice movie to watch (atleast for once), especially if you like a somewhat mysterious atmosphere and less blood and gore than is usual for a zombie movie. If you, on top of that, try to really comprehend the new twists and turns and the explanation for the zombie infestation and use your imagination, this film will leave you wondering and ensure you'll have had a good time.\n\n*First review ever*", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Pontypool", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1386283545", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjMwMDQzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI4NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjMwMDQzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI4NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A psychological thriller in which a deadly virus infects a small Ontario town.", "uploadDate": "2009-05-06T08:36:36Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226681", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pontypool", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pontypool/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pontypool/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pontypool/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pontypool/thumb.jpg"}
