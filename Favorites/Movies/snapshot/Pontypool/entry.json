It's a zombie flick that isn't a zombie flick--it really breaks out of the genre. At times honestly hilarious and truly suspenseful at others, it was one of my top three films I saw at the festival. The IMDb synopsis doesn't do it justice. The main character loves to throw out references to linguistics and literary critics, and the \"transmission\" of the virus fits perfectly. Stephen McHattie did a fantastic job, as did Lisa Houle and Georgina Reilly. Even though the \"we're stuck in a building surrounded by zombies\" is a well-used setup, Pontypool is so different from most zombie movies that it doesn't feel hackneyed. Altogether, it's a totally fresh, exciting movie. If you can get your hands on it, watch it!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Pontypool", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1386283545", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjMwMDQzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI4NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjMwMDQzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI4NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A psychological thriller in which a deadly virus infects a small Ontario town.", "uploadDate": "2009-05-06T08:36:36Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226681", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pontypool", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pontypool/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pontypool/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pontypool/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-09-12"}
