The back of the book had me laughing and intrigued by the description.\n\nA virus. Flesh eating zombies. A body count in the millions has decimated Ontario's population. What if you woke up and began your morning by devoting the rest of your life to a murderous rampage, a never-ending cannibalistic spree? And what if you were only one of thousands who shared the same compulsion? This novel depicts just such an epidemic. It's the compelling, terrifying story of a devastating virus.\n\nI will not tell you how you catch it so as not to include spoilers, but once it has you, it leads you on a strange journey\u0097into another world where the undead chase you down the streets of the smallest towns and largest cities.\n\nIf you are expecting a night of the living dead style film... this is not it. This movie does a fantastic job of drawing you into the world of the characters, their relationships and everything falling apart around them; you are not an outside observer. You are for all intensive purposes just another Pontypool citizen wondering \"Wiskey-Tango-Foxtrot\".\n\nThis movie is a great treat for four reasons 1) The focus on the actors as the actors were perfectly cast. You may recognize an actress from the recent release of Dark Room 2) The choice to follow the \"Aliens\" model of never placing the source of \"fear and unease\" front stage. By not letting you in on the whole thing and only providing glimpses, your imagination will take the scenes further than any expensive CGI ever could. 3) The writing and angle of the movie. You feel like you are part of the movie as you only know what the main actors know... nothing more! 4)The intro and the voice of the main actor really pull you in like a warm sedative as you spiral downward into the insanity of your own imagination.\n\nEnjoy... we did!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H33M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Pontypool", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1386283545", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjMwMDQzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI4NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2MjMwMDQzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI4NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A psychological thriller in which a deadly virus infects a small Ontario town.", "uploadDate": "2009-05-06T08:36:36Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1226681", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pontypool", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pontypool/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pontypool/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pontypool/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Pontypool/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-09-12"}
