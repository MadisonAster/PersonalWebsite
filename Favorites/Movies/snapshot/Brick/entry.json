How disappointed I was. There are many defects and errors in this film. Here is my list: \n\nI found the dialogue inaudible and when I did hear what the characters were saying I found it completely incomprehensible.\n\nThe lead who played Brendan has to be the most uncharismatic actor I have ever seen on screen. Top marks to this guy for being able to deliver the gibberish dialogue, but aside from that this anti-hero character that he plays is truly repellent. Even the poorest most unpopular student in high school wouldn't have bad hair, bad shoes, and completely ill fitting denim pants. Do all squares have to be so unstylish? How can someone so skinny and badly dressed walk around like he's a jock and not to be messed with? The Laura character is prematurely middle-aged and totally pretentious and irritating and that's only when you can hear what she's actually saying. If this film is a satire on American youth - where everyone is sixteen going on 42 then it works on this premise. However I don't believe for a moment that there is even a high school in Hollywood where all the kids talk in hyper-slang with perfectly polished sophisticated responses. This film could never be called realistic.\n\nThe only redeeming feature in this project is the lovely Emilie De Ravin who unfortunately plays the soon-to-be dead girlfriend Emily. If she played Laura she would have had more screen time and perhaps would have delivered the strange dialogue with more clarity than the actress who played her.\n\nDe Ravin is like a composite of Jodie Foster and Michell Pfeiffer when they were younger. And and yet far from reminding us of them, she also seems to possess an ethereal quality that transcend that initial impression - innocence corrupted springs to mind when I saw here in this flick. I hope this is the start of a glittering career for her. \n\nWatch out pointy chinned Witherspoon!"}, "duration": "PT1H50M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393109", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Brick", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Brick/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Brick/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Brick/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Brick/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-03-30"}
