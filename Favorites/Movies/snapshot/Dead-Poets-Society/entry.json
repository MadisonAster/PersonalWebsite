It was an all around good film. Perhaps I'm biased - Robert Frost's poem, A Road Not Taken, was quoted - yet so many other things were as well.\n\nIt's not about poetry. It's about how you look at the world. How you look, how others look... how you think, how you feel... and a warning to never, ever become conformist (though being conformist about walking is perhaps slightly exaggerated). Never become conformist - always make up your own mind.\n\nI liked the music, as well. The bag pipes give a certain special touch.\n\nI gave it an 8/10 - a high score for me.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H8M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097165", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dead-Poets-Society", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dead-Poets-Society/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dead-Poets-Society/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dead-Poets-Society/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dead-Poets-Society/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
