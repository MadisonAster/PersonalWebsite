The first time I saw it I watched it solely for plot and I loved it. Now I've seen it again and watched Peter Weir's filming and timing which is also great. Robin Williams is a terrific actor when he's serious. He proved it in Good Will Hunting but he proved it first here. If you liked that movie and your liking it had something to do with Williams than you will like this one. The plot is about a number of students who are taught by Williams about life. They are taught how to enjoy themselves. This ends up causing great controversy among the heads of the school. The students are terrific and even the dialogue is great. This is a movie that I can't imagine anyone not liking. It is good in every way."}, "duration": "PT2H8M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097165", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dead-Poets-Society", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dead-Poets-Society/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dead-Poets-Society/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Dead-Poets-Society/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
