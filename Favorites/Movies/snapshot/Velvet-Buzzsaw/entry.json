The paranormal slaying artwork was cool and it was filled with people I wanted to see killed. The unfortunate part is that there was no really likable characters, the only one that got close was John Malkovich but there was not enough scenes to save it. The movie is good but I feel it is going to divide horror fans . There are plenty off beautiful scenes and art and I am really trying to figure out why there were so many shots of eyes I am positive I'm missing something from that and that's why I feel it wont be received well. it has a sense of wonder about it and people today don't like that, they want everything force feed. I recommend giving this one a couple viewings on face book and discover. I personally enjoyed the film but it did not do enough to make a great horror just a good one.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT1H53M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi487701017", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYwZWI2YjItYmEwMC00NzBlLWE2ZTQtODgwMGVhNWZhODM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYwZWI2YjItYmEwMC00NzBlLWE2ZTQtODgwMGVhNWZhODM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "After a series of paintings by an unknown artist are discovered, a supernatural force enacts revenge on those who have allowed their greed to get in the way of art.", "uploadDate": "2019-01-10T14:48:31Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7043012", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Velvet-Buzzsaw", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Velvet-Buzzsaw/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Velvet-Buzzsaw/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Velvet-Buzzsaw/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
