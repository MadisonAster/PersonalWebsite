Who really runs the show and what is it all about. In The Institute, the viewer is taken as a few chosen ones are taken on a riddled filled adventure full of twist and turns. They are lead on a wild goose chase and their perceptions changed as the secrets of a whole unseen underworld is presented in front of them.

The journey takes you in and out all type of locations, a busy street, a serene park, and the final resting place for some bookish type. The end is at a bringing together of these adventurous souls. I saw this film as part of the Atlanta Film Festival", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "A documentary on the Jejune Institute, a mind-bending San Francisco phenomenon where 10,000 people became \"inducted\" without ever quite realizing what they'd signed up for.", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1386915865", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NTgzMjg4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjk5MzUzMDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NTgzMjg4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjk5MzUzMDE@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2013-10-01T17:02:35Z"}, "url": "/title/tt2386327/"}
