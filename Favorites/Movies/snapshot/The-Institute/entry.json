From the start, the film has incredibly compelling visuals and soundtrack, but the interviews with members (?) seem pretty straight forward. As the movie continues though, it seems as though things start twisting and the information may or may not be \"real.\" Are these people acting? Is this even what happened? It might all be fake, or it might all be real, or a beautiful mixture of fact and fiction. Regardless, it looks like it was a lot of fun to participate, and I love the idea of having things like this going on around you without your knowledge. I recommend watching the movie (I think you can get it on iTunes) and seeing if you can tell what is real -- if anything.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1386915865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NTgzMjg4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjk5MzUzMDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NTgzMjg4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjk5MzUzMDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A documentary on the Jejune Institute, a mind-bending San Francisco phenomenon where 10,000 people became \"inducted\" without ever quite realizing what they'd signed up for.", "uploadDate": "2013-10-01T17:02:35Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2386327", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Institute", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Institute/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Institute/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Institute/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-11-14"}
