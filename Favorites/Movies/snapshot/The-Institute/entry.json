A film that is related to the NSA's Mind Control program...", "reviewBody": "There have been many attempts to do a straight up documentary about the NSA's Mind Control program, but it's been shot down every time it gets going. Someone in the govt gets wind of it and then before it even gets off the ground, the project is terminated. \n\nThis seems to take ALL of the aspects of what Targeted Individuals experience-- Electronic Harassment, gang stalking, EEG Cloning with supercomputers that send back other negative cloned emotions from other individuals via electromagnetic microwaves. In order to map a person's electromagnetic signature, you have to have them in one spot for a good while to capture their unique signal. That's why most TI's are picked up at low income apartment buildings... they clone them there, through walls, then once they have the signature signal... they're tagged for life. I'm surprised this project got this far... even though they're turning some of the story into fiction, by making it look like a game. It should be interesting to see what other projects come out, now that this has been released."}, "duration": "PT1H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1386915865", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NTgzMjg4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjk5MzUzMDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NTgzMjg4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjk5MzUzMDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A documentary on the Jejune Institute, a mind-bending San Francisco phenomenon where 10,000 people became \"inducted\" without ever quite realizing what they'd signed up for.", "uploadDate": "2013-10-01T17:02:35Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2386327", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Institute", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Institute/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Institute/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Institute/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Institute/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-11-14"}
