I always enjoy films based on a true story, especially when they are as unique and interesting as this one. It's also always refreshing to see a biographical film without knowing anything about the story beforehand. I for one had never heard of Molly Bloom or her story, so it really made for fascinating viewing.\n\nThe film runs very smoothly and despite the rather long running length, it never goes through any lulls and always feels fast-paced and on the move. 'Molly's Game' is not only an entertaining film but it's also informative and educational. The story is approached well, digging beyond the surface and ensuring no detail is missed from the story.\n\n'Molly's Game' is a strong biographical drama that does a very good job overall at telling a fascinating story.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H20M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer With Commentary From Director Aaron Sorkin", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1887483929", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDNhZTM2NDYtZGU2MS00YThmLTk3OTMtNDRjY2ZjY2EwYWI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDNhZTM2NDYtZGU2MS00YThmLTk3OTMtNDRjY2ZjY2EwYWI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Aaron Sorkin annotates the theatrical trailer for 'Molly's Game' to give you more insight to his movie.", "uploadDate": "2017-12-22T19:33:55Z"}, "Title": "Molly's Game", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4209788", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mollys-Game", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mollys-Game/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mollys-Game/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mollys-Game/entry.json"}
