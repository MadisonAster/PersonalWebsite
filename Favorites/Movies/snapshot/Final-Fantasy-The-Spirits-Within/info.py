                          'original, with marauding aliens nearly vanquishing '

                          'characters a bit of a puppetry feel at times.  The '
                          'movement of humans in CG is still not quite fluid, '
                          'but getting much better. Also, the movie slows down '

                          'minutes, which is perhaps necessary for the plot, '
                          'but the change in pace was notable, even with the '

                          'The Good.  The imagery in this movie is startling, '
                          "imaginative, complex, even awesome at times.  It's "
                          'amazing that while the machines, vehicles, and '
                          'mechanics in the movie are so realistic and '
                          'detailed, so too are the organic forms such as the '
                          'alien presence (sometimes seemingly more fluidly '
                          'animated than the humans!) and the incredible '
                          'landscapes.  It is obvious how much imagination '
                          'went in to so many aspects of this movie.  The '
                          'soundtrack, while not exceptional, is very '
                          'complimentary and captures the dark feel with the '
                          'fast action and triumphant climaxes.  The '
                          'characters were distinct, like-able, and voiced '
                          "very well (even if the digital mouths don't quite "
                          'match up most of the time).  The emotional scenes, '
                          'while certainly not perfect and a bit awkward, '
                          'should be given grand credit for achieving the '
                          "level they do convey.  If you let yourself go, it's "
                          'not impossible to be entranced by all that this '
                          'movie actually manages to pull off.  If nothing '
                          'else, then the effects alone are worth seeing, if '
                          'the somewhat hokey spiritual elements of the plot '
                          'turn you off.  (If you consider the Force to be '
                          "hokey, don't bother.)\n"
                          '\n'
                          'The Surprising.  Well, I was a bit put off by the '
                          'simplistic way the characters would look at each '
                          'situation and then spell it out to the audience, '
                          'though there is more to the plot than casual sci-fi '
                          'fare. Because of this, the dialogue was a bit goofy '
                          'at times, but at least it usually fit the '
                          "characters.  But every good thing you've heard "
                          'about the quality of the CG work in this movie is '
                          'true- it really is a site to behold, if nothing '
                          'else than for the effects.  As I mentioned earlier, '
                          'if you consider how much this movie is trying to '
                          "do, it's amazing that it pulled off everything "
                          'nearly as well as it does.\n'
                          '\n'
                          'So, I think that most will be pleased, some will '
                          'critique it heavily on the negatives and not be as '
                          'impressed, but the bottom line is that it is '
                          'definitely worth seeing.  Quality work in most '
                          'areas, even story and screenplay in my opinion '
                          "(though that's certainly the most debatable point.) "
