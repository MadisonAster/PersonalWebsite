Tom Hanks, in my opinion, gave the performance of his career by bringing emotion and depth to his part. The only actor that bettered him was Michael Clarke Duncan. How he made this giant like character into a vulnerable pussycat was a marvel. On whole, the cast came together and gave the best performance I have seen in a movie for a long time. Not one of them let the side down by being weak. David Morse who is more known for his supporting roles was also excellent and hopefully not long till he's carrying his own movie. If you haven't seen this get it out now,forget about the running time and connections to 'The Shawshank Redemption' and enjoy it for what it is, a little miracle. 4 out of 5", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT3H9M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Green Mile", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi552796441", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU4NmYyMzEtNzkwNy00NmFlLTk3YWItM2I5NDk3YTUyODFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU4NmYyMzEtNzkwNy00NmFlLTk3YWItM2I5NDk3YTUyODFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:45:12Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120689", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Green-Mile", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Green-Mile/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Green-Mile/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Green-Mile/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
