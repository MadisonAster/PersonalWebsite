                          'using fast camera work and aggressive shots, Raimi '
                          'has created an eerie world that is sometimes hard '
                          'to look at but too entertaining to turn away from. '
                          'His style from behind the camera is absolutely '
                          'unmistakable. This is perfectly exemplified in the '
                          'beginning of the film, where the camera alone '
                          'creates enough atmosphere to leave you biting your '
                          "nails in suspense of what's to come. You feel at "
                          'any moment someone is going to get their neck '
                          'chomped on by some zombie hiding just out of view. '
                          'One of the most impressive openings I can think of, '
                          'perfection in pacing and atmosphere. It gets even '
                          'better once the action starts. Some shots hold for '
                          'a seeming eternity, and part of you wishes for it '
                          "to stop for it's unrestrained gore and "
                          'violence...but the other part of you is getting a '
                          'sick kick out of it. One of the most impressive '
                          'shots is where the darkness from the trees begins '
                          'to chase people, knocking any tree or obstacle down '

                          '\n'
                          "TED also succeeds because it's self-aware of the "
                          "fact that it's a simple zombie movie and never "
                          "takes itself too seriously, and doesn't expect the "
                          "audience to do so either. It's meant to be campy, "
