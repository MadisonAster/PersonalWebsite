                          'is truly one of the greatest horror films of all '

                          'trilogy of hilarity and some real scares. Made on a '
                          'budget of only $375,000, the film is surprisingly '
                          'accomplished on a technical level. The effects, '
                          "although they do look fake by today's standards, "
                          'hold up a lot better than you might have expected, '
                          'and the stop motion sequence at the end, which '

                          '"The Evil Dead" is about a group of young adults '
                          'who travel to a cabin in the woods and discover a '
                          "'book of the dead'. No prizes for guessing what "
                          'happens next as each character is possessed (except '
                          'for Ash) and disposed of via an intriguing variety '
                          'of methods. Considering its budget, unknown '
                          'director (at the time), and typical slasher plot '
                          '"The Evil Dead" would almost certainly seem headed '
                          'towards forgotten B-movie status, and yet it has '
                          'stood the test of time and remains one of the most '
                          'widely acclaimed horror films of all time. Why? '
                          'It\'s simple. Although "The Evil Dead" is nowhere '
                          "near as funny as its sequels, it's still a humorous "
                          'self-satire while also being terrifying despite its '
                          'age. This odd combination (only perfected in this '
                          'film\'s sequels and "Creepshow") works because '
                          'Raimi crafts a tense and moody environment, puts '
                          'his characters in there, and then ruthlessly '
                          'disposes of them, sometimes doing so several times '
                          "for the same character. What's worse is that "
                          "there's nowhere to go. Raimi creates a "
                          'claustrophobic feeling in anyone watching, he wants '
                          'you to think about being in a situation where '
