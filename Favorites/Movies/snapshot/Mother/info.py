                          'me with this one. Not only did he manage to grab me '
                          'on an intellectual level, but also on an emotional '
                          'one. This movie is going to be hated by many, I '
                          'know that now. But for me, this is, hands down, the '
                          'movie of the year. Every shot, cut, and scream is '
                          'perfectly constructed to make an immersive '
                          "atmosphere that never relents in it's uncomfortable "
                          'feeling, and the acting is seriously award worthy. '

                          "top notch. At first I couldn't quite relate to her "

                          'became my mindset, and we essentially merged into '
                          'one force of fear and terror that was absolutely '
                          'unstoppable until the ending. I cannot praise her '
                          'performance enough in this review. Her emotions '
                          'leaked from every frame she was in, and it broke my '
                          'heart and scared me witless the whole way through '

                          'that felt very satisfying. The whole way through, I '

                          'of it. Watching this in a theater was like being in '
