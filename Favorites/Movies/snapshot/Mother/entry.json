They want you to hate someone's piece of art based on their own emotional issues toward an actor or idea.\n\nThe film is a true work of art, displaying US and OUR collective, destructive behavior, right in your face! Darren doesn't care what you or some critic thinks, he did this because he had to. We are killing ourselves and our MOTHER and this is an artful yet harsh, radical reminder of that.\n\nWatch this film so that more chances can be made in Hollywood. We are also killing our children's brains with all of the comic-book junk they usually make and artful films like this don't and won't get chances to be digested without support.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "A couple's relationship is tested when uninvited guests arrive at their home, disrupting their tranquil existence.", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2921576729", "name": "Trailer", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzVmYTdiZjctMDE5NS00M2RlLWIxNTAtYjJmMWE1MmUzOTBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzVmYTdiZjctMDE5NS00M2RlLWIxNTAtYjJmMWE1MmUzOTBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2017-08-07T19:48:40Z"}, "url": "/title/tt5109784/", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
