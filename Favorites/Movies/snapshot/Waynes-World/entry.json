Though it's far from being my favourite movie of all time, it still hits the targets its designed to and manages to smell sweet when compared to the more recent torrent of comparative sewage that is hailed as gross-out 'comedy'.\n\nOddly, perhaps, it's impossible to dislike or find the two (Mike Myers and Dana Carvey) super-geeks annoying. The film is bright and breezy and rolls along like a continual Friday night out and the rock music references, including the famous Bohemian Rhapsody sung in their tiny car, always welcome.\n\nThe dream women in their lives are indeed good-looking girls and their portrayal are a fair balance between teenage male hormonal fantasy and real people with substance and character.\n\nConsidering Waynes World is supposed to be a Cult Movie, I'm surprised how few reviews there are here, on Amazon. Whether new audiences will ever warm to WW is a different matter altogether but for of us who's seen it come, go and now hang around, it still offers many pleasures.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105793", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waynes-World", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waynes-World/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waynes-World/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waynes-World/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waynes-World/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
