This is the film that catapulted both comedians' careers into the stratosphere. 1992 is an interesting time in alternative rock history between the peak of grunge in 1991, and the coming crest of the \"punk revival\" in 1994 with Green Day, Offspring and Rancid. Wayne's World reveled in this new \"alternative rock,\" music a concept which was at the time much more flexible than it is now. Rife with irony, alternative rock was eventually the name given to the music that blended aspects of rock, metal, punk, pop, and eclectic \"weirdness.\" While Wayne is the more metal half of the excellent duo, Garth is the grunge/nerd/\"punk\" side of the equation. \n\nHeavy metal rock and roll fandom provides the backdrop for a non-stop train wreck of social satire. Only in 1992; and only in Meyer's and Carvey's comedic genius could Aurora, Illinois ever seem so cool. Wayne's World, in the film's plot, is the name of a Cable Access television show (dare I say \"DIY\") hosted by Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar. Rob Lowe plays Benjamin, an advertising scout/producer who is looking for talent to promote a chain of video game arcade stores. He finds his muse in the low-brow witticism, promptly signs the boys, and sets them up in a proper television studio. A battle ensues between Ben and Wayne for the affection of one way-hot Cassandra (Tia Carrere) who is easily lured away from Wayne at the first flourish of Benjamin's bountiful extravagance. Wayne and Garth's plans to win back Cassandra culminate in the film's tripartite finale. \n\n\"...with an underlying revisionist's conceit that belied the film's emotional attachments to the subject matter...\" the film was truly entertaining, whimsical, and relevant. And to reassure Garth; No, it did not suck.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105793", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waynes-World", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waynes-World/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waynes-World/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waynes-World/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
