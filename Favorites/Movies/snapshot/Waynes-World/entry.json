The story thickens to a nice touch with Rob Lowe as a big time hot-shot who wants to bring their show to big heights.  Tia Carrere has never been hotter as the woman who Wayne wants and \"we'll be mine\".  Many sight gags, many good lines, and probably all quotable, this movie (like Myers' Austin Powers) belongs in a place in comedy film history.
