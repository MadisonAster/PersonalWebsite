When Ian meets a girl called Tasty (Katrina Bowden) in Internet, he writes many lies about himself; when she invites him to drive to Knoxville, Tennessee, to have sex with her, Ian steals Rex's GTO Judge 1969 and travels with Lance and Felicia. When they have trouble on the road with the car, the Amish Ezekiel (Seth Green) offers to help them in his community. Lance meets the Amish Mary (Alice Greczyn) and they fall in love for each other. During their travel, Ian and Felicia discover that their feelings are more than friendship and that Tasty is not who she told she is.\n\nI am still laughing with \"Sex Drive\" since this movie is one of the funniest comedies that I have recently seen. There are many gross jokes, beautiful tits and girls and enjoyable characters. The cynical Seth Green is simply hilarious in the role of a sympathetic Amish. The scene when Ian is on the stage watching the dancers backstage while a pregnant girl is telling her sad story is so funny that I needed to stop the movie just to laugh. The last scene with Amanda Crew in the end of the credits is also very funny, and I believe many people probably lost this joke. If you are intellectual, or if you do not like this type of movie, please do not spend your time to write bad reviews in IMDb. I can not understand how a viewer can be surprised with the content of a comedy that begins the way \"Sex Drive\" does. Amanda Crew, Katrina Bowden, Alice Greczyn and all the female cast are incredibly gorgeous. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): \"Sex Drive\"", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Sex Drive: Theatrical Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3200385305", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NTU5NDQ0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUzNTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NTU5NDQ0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUzNTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "This is the theatrical trailer for Sex Drive, directed by Sean Anders.", "uploadDate": "2008-08-05T06:50:21Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135985", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sex-Drive", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sex-Drive/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sex-Drive/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Sex-Drive/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-20"}
