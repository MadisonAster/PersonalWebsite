It's an improbable cross between \"Brazil\" \"a clockwork orange\" and the video game HALF-LIFE2 (from which it borrows it's final sequences and use of on shot action-sequences) it manages to be both entertaining in the Hollywood way (with incredible action sequences and a very clever way of using digital effects) yet very sad and different with a very very dark and realistic overtone. No comic relief, no cartoon character bravery, only human behavior in it's best and most horrible way. This realistic overtone makes the main characters very engaging and moving. CLive owen (whose i have always disliked) is excellent as the man drowned into an adventure too big for him (sorry for my bad English)\n\nIt's the same kind of film than V for vendetta (both taking place in a futuristic fascist British society) different from the usual mainstrean studio teenager pleaser crap\n\nGO see it! help intelligent cinema", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206634", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Children-of-Men", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Children-of-Men/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Children-of-Men/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Children-of-Men/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
