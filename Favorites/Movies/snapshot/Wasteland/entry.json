Flimsy story lines, flimsier plots and character development to name just a few of my gripes. Very few stand up against what the rest of the world has to offer.\n\nI went into this film with very little expectation, and up until the last 30 mins it seemed I was to be proved right yet again....not so!\n\nA great watch in the end. Yes, the storyline doesn't tread any new ground. But what it does, it does very well I think. It seems to plod along quite nicely with some decent enough character development and acting (but to be honest nothing spectacular). But the plot and the twists towards the end are well worth the wait. And kudos to the director/writer to leave in a 'did he/didn't he' scenario, where it is left to the viewers imagination as to what happens next. Far too few film makers do this in my opinion, preferring to spoon-feed the audience every bit of detail.\n\nI was also impressed with the soundtrack. Very contemporary (with the odd golden oldie thrown in), and which was actually quite emotional at times.\n\nI must admit I have been rather generous in rating this a 7/10. But that is because I am just so pleased that something of this quality has been produced in Britain.\n\nWould definitely recommend this.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "A young Englishman recently released from prison recruits his three best friends and to rob the local drug kingpin who is responsible for his incarceration.
