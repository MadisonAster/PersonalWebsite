'Flash of Genius' tells the heartbreaking story of inventer Dr. Kearns. While windshield wipers may sound like a small thing that hardly many give consideration to (as Kearns's friends have told him), it's not a matter of the object at hand but the effort that went behind it and why should credit go to somebody else? I admire Kearns for putting up a fight and keeping up the battle for justice and even though it cost him his family, he fought to the end. I'm surprised as to how little recognition 'Flash of Genius' received considering that the story is extremely relevant even for today's world.\n\nThe director does a splendid job in telling this moving story. Greg Kinnear delivers a heartfelt lowkeyed performance which is among one of the best of his career. Unfortunately, he remains an underrated actor but I hope he keeps making the wise film choices and gets his due soon. Lauren Graham is wonderfully restrained and marvelous but she's risking getting typecast (she's played supportive wife in two other recent movies 'Evan Almighty' and 'Birds of America'). Dermot Mulroney too stands out as Privick. \n\nWhere the technical department is concerned, the director has used a lot of subtlety with the cinematography, soundtrack and visuals. It is only later that we realize what an important symbol rain is in this movie. The washed out colour adds to the tense, stressful and sad atmosphere. 'Flash of Genius' is definitely a worthy watch not only because it tells an engaging story but a very relevant one."}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Flash of Genius: Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1591476505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyODczMjI3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk2ODQyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyODczMjI3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk2ODQyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "This is the first trailer for Flash of Genius, directed by Marc Abraham.", "uploadDate": "2008-07-22T15:33:18Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1054588", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Flash-of-Genius", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Flash-of-Genius/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Flash-of-Genius/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Flash-of-Genius/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Flash-of-Genius/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
