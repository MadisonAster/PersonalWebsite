He has certainly put all of himself in every role he has undertaken. From the host of E Entertainment's 'Talk Soup', onto such film roles as 'Little Miss Sunshine','Auto Focus' & this fine film. Kinnear plays a downtrodden Joe Sixpack from the suburbs, with his wife & six children. Here he is an engineering professor who has re-invented the windshield wiper (or did he just upgrade it?), only to have his idea stolen by Ford Motors. After 12 years of struggle that includes a nervous breakdown & the melt down of his marriage, he finally has his day in court. Does he emerge the victorious? I won't kiss & tell. This is a quiet,understated little film that deserved far better than it got. Alan Alda also shines as his attorney that tries to go to bat for him. This is one of those films that (hopefully)will have a second chance when it gets released on DVD. Slapped a PG-13 by the MPAA for some salty language,a moment of sensuality & some rather erratic behavior,due to a nervous breakdown.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Flash of Genius: Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1591476505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyODczMjI3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk2ODQyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyODczMjI3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk2ODQyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "This is the first trailer for Flash of Genius, directed by Marc Abraham.", "uploadDate": "2008-07-22T15:33:18Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1054588", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Flash-of-Genius", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Flash-of-Genius/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Flash-of-Genius/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Flash-of-Genius/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Flash-of-Genius/thumb.jpg"}
