But that is exactly what Hong Kong pop star-turned-director, Juno Mak finds himself with his first film, Rigor Mortis.\n\nDescribed as a tribute to the horror-comedy series Mr. Vampire, Rigor Mortis takes its audience to an apartment complex where aging actor Chin Sui-Ho finds himself moping after the loss of his wife and son. Ghosts and spirits are already known to loiter the halls of the building, but when a grieving resident attempts a ritual to bring her husband back from the dead the residents are forced to confront the evil of the supernatural including a vampire like creature that terrorizes the residents.\n\nFilled with some remarkable effects complimenting the very dark and dreary setting of the depraved building, Rigor Mortis is pea soup thick with atmosphere. Asian cinema has always been the front runners in bringing ghost stories to the masses (Dark Water, Ju-on, Ringu), and director Juno Mak has surrounded himself with a top effects team to bring his creatures to life.\n\nUnfortunately, the visuals are not enough to save the film from the mediocrity pool. The script is slow in getting to the goods and its complexity reminded us of Timur Bekmambetov's Night Watch \u2013 a glorious looking film that got lost among its effects. The indulgence is particularly evident in the film's finale which includes a wonderful fight between our protagonist, the vampire like creature and two ghostly twins.\n\nFans of the Mr. Vampire series may end up scratching their heads wondering where the comedic punch from their series has gone as Rigor Mortis has hardly two laughs to share from credits to credits. It's as serious as a heart-attack even if the EKG indicates it only to be a mild one. Suicides, rape and even the placement of harm's way of a small boy are some of the serious overtones that engulf the moods of the film. Usually such melancholy is exactly what the horror doctor orders, but Rigor Mortis plays more like a psychedelic bad dream than a viable horror film worthy of our recommendation.\n\nwww.killerreviews.com", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H43M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Rigor Mortis", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2877466905", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjgxMjk1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM5MDQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjgxMjk1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM5MDQzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Rigor Mortis", "uploadDate": "2013-07-10T12:17:38Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2771800", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Rigor-Mortis", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Rigor-Mortis/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Rigor-Mortis/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Rigor-Mortis/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Rigor-Mortis/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-08-03"}
