A tortured federal agent, haunted by a painful tragedy and obsessed with catching the slick sociopathic terrorist who's eluded him for years and years, is forced to take the face of his mortal enemy in order to acquire vital information. The daring plan quickly goes awry when he loses his own identity in the process, and discovers his arch-enemy is cohabiting with his family. Film's enjoyment depends on the viewer: you'll either condemn the story as absurd and far-fetched, or you'll buy into it and go along for this supercharged, over-the-top action extravaganza. Travolta and Cage are both extraordinarily good, and with Woo at the helm you know that you'd better hang on for dear life! Occasionally silly, with a plot that tosses credibility out the window, but still a helluva lot of fun. ***"}, "duration": "PT2H18M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Face/Off", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3188700185", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMWNjYzktYTVmYy00YjJjLTlhMzUtYWVhMmJjZjlkZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMWNjYzktYTVmYy00YjJjLTlhMzUtYWVhMmJjZjlkZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer", "uploadDate": "2016-06-03T21:20:19Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119094", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/FaceOff", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/FaceOff/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/FaceOff/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/FaceOff/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
