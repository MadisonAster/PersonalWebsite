Forget about the fact that it is wonderfully acted by Vince Vaughn and Vincend D'Onofrio. Forget about the fact that it is one of the few movies starring Jennifer Lopez that I can stomach. Although the story may be impossible to believe and much of the dialogue seems contrived, the one and only important thing to remember when contemplating watching this movie is that it contains some of the most amazing and disturbing imagery ever put on film. It is as if Salvador Dali decided to make a crime drama. A must see for anyone seriously interested in cinematography and the use of the film cell as a canvas on which to display true works of visual art. I would have to give this movie a 9/10 for it's amazing visual display.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Cell", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4235764761", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmU3MWZmZTAtZWYwOC00ODAzLTk0YzktNmM2ODAxODU3Y2FjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmU3MWZmZTAtZWYwOC00ODAzLTk0YzktNmM2ODAxODU3Y2FjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Cell", "uploadDate": "2012-10-27T03:34:48Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0209958", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Cell", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Cell/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Cell/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Cell/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Cell/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-03-24"}
