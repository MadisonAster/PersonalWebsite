When we meet him he is already rotten. He is mere months away from his arrest.\n\nThere is in Robert DeNiro's portrayal little or nothing to like or empathize with. Or care about. What we have is a true sociopath who is found out early in the film, which forces us to see nothing but the devastation left in his wake.\n\nThis is my way of saying there is no story arc. There are no surprises. What flashbacks there are show Madoff in his personal life but always at his worst.\n\nMichelle Pheiffer as Madoff's wife has a small rand unconvincing role. And like her husband, I couldn't care less about her fate. As for the Madoff sons, to some degree this is more their story than anyone else's. And to the degree that I learned quite a bit about them, the film deserves credit.\n\nBut that is not enough to warrant its viewing.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "duration": "PT2H13M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Tonight 8/7c", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi42121497", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The story of Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scheme.", "uploadDate": "2017-05-17T17:20:38Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1933667", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Wizard-of-Lies", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Wizard-of-Lies/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Wizard-of-Lies/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Wizard-of-Lies/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Wizard-of-Lies/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2017-05-24"}
