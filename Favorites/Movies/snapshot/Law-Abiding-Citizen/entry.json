It was not predictable. The actors were great in their roles except for a sub-par Leslie Bibb (TV actress with waning looks). After the first five minutes I thought I made my assumptions of what was going to happen but I was totally wrong.\n\nGerard Butler and Jamie Foxx work perfect against each other. There are a few lulls in the movie towards the end but overall it was a real good movie.\n\nPerhaps the message of this movie can somehow persuade real change in our legal practices. It is worth seeing. The way the film is shot and the sound effects make this an intense movie.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Law Abiding Citizen: \"Don't Even Twitch\"", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1598816793", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2MDQ2MTEzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk2ODA5Mg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2MDQ2MTEzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk2ODA5Mg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A clip from the movie Law Abiding Citizen.", "uploadDate": "2009-10-15T13:30:58Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1197624", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Law-Abiding-Citizen", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Law-Abiding-Citizen/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Law-Abiding-Citizen/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Law-Abiding-Citizen/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Law-Abiding-Citizen/thumb.jpg"}
