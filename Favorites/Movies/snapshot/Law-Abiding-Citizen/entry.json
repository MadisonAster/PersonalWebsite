Law Abiding Citizen is a great movie but the ending sucks.\n\nThe problem is, with about 30 minutes to go, the movie wants us to stop cheering on Clyde (Gerry Butler) and suddenly start thinking of Nick (Jamie Foxx) as the hero. That's not going to work, the audience has just invested about 90 minutes of wanting Clyde to continue with his vengeance. Damn right too.\n\nThe plot should have continued to its logical conclusion. Clyde was trying to teach Nick a lesson, that the system was so broken that it could only be fixed by being destroyed first. Rather than the squeaky-Hollywood-ending-slop they served up, here's what should have happened...\n\nIn the solitary confinement cell at the end, Jamie Foxx's character Nick should have taken the cell-phone from Clyde then remote-detonated the bomb at city hall, blowing up the mayor, the brass, the whole rotten system, then gone off to watch his daughter's cello recital.\n\nNow, that ending would have been really insane, but it would have taken the movie to its logical conclusion. Nick's conversion would have been complete. As an ending, it would be right up there with Jimmy Cagney at the end of White Heat, 'Made it Ma, top of the world!' Morally dubious, yes, but it would have given us a bona-fide classic. It would be rating 9.8 here on IMDb rather than this insipid seven-point-bleh.\n\nOh, and the movie loses a point for Gerard Butler not using his own voice. Gerry is a Scot and has a fine Glasgow accent, he should use it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Law Abiding Citizen: \"Don't Even Twitch\"", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1598816793", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2MDQ2MTEzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk2ODA5Mg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2MDQ2MTEzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzk2ODA5Mg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A clip from the movie Law Abiding Citizen.", "uploadDate": "2009-10-15T13:30:58Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1197624", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Law-Abiding-Citizen", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Law-Abiding-Citizen/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Law-Abiding-Citizen/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Law-Abiding-Citizen/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
