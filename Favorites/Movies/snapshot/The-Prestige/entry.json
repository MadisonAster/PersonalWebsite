Most movies have me leave the theater feeling like I wasted 8 dollars or so. So many movies lately have left me feeling like I wasted away precious hors of my life that could have been spent doing better things. Yet this movie was truly a masterpiece and kept me guessing the whole time. The acting was superb and so was the plot. I usually can predict the outcomes of movies pretty early on. And usually I can see the twist the writer planned. With this movie I was still left wondering into the last 5 minutes of the movie. I can't wait to own this on DVD.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H10M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2885334553", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMzMyNzE0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDU4NDM0MDI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMzMyNzE0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDU4NDM0MDI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Two stage magicians engage in competitive one-upmanship in an attempt to create the ultimate stage illusion.", "uploadDate": "2016-10-27T01:19:48Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482571", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Prestige", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Prestige/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Prestige/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Prestige/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Prestige/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-07-08"}
