And if you don't get it, you will hate it. Open minded viewers need only apply, and that's certainly the case with \"Happiness.\" I remember leaving the theater absolutely shocked, and not just because of the events on screen. I was shocked that I found the movie so intelligent and oddly entertaining. The actors surely must have felt that, after reading the screenplay. And there are some big actors in this--veterans like Ben Gazzara, Louise Lasser, Elizabeth Ashley, mixing with new talent like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Camryn Manheim, Dylan Baker, Lara Flynn Boyle, etc. \n\nThe subject matter is truly unsettling--a parental figure, respected in his community, does some horrible things, and this is the main reason why so many people have a hard time with this movie. Did this material really need to be examined in modern cinema? Well, yes--in the same way that David Lynch had to explore it in Blue Velvet. Happiness is a masterpiece of irony (even in the title), and finds humor in the most unusual and downright bizarre circumstances. You will not see another movie like it. Guaranteed. And fair warning--you could very well despise it. And it's probably a fair estimate that its writer/director, Todd Solondz, doesn't give a damn."}, "duration": "PT2H14M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Happiness", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi632029465", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE4OTBlZmItYzczZC00MTllLWJmNjQtNDFlMGM2ODMxMjg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE4OTBlZmItYzczZC00MTllLWJmNjQtNDFlMGM2ODMxMjg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Trimark", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:23:11Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0147612", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Happiness", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Happiness/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Happiness/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Happiness/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Happiness/thumb.jpg"}
