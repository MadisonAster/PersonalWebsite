It explores aspects of life and living (and suffering) that most films avoid or actively deny. And it does so brilliantly.  The characters are vividly real, and there is such a strong sense of situations unfolding in real time that it's truly mesmerising.  I felt like a fly on the wall, eavesdropping on conversations I could never hear otherwise.  I think many people would absolutely hate this movie, partly because it doesn't pass judgement on behaviours that are repulsive to the bulk of humanity, and partly because it exposes us to them at all.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H14M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Happiness", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi632029465", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE4OTBlZmItYzczZC00MTllLWJmNjQtNDFlMGM2ODMxMjg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE4OTBlZmItYzczZC00MTllLWJmNjQtNDFlMGM2ODMxMjg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Trimark", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:23:11Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0147612", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Happiness", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Happiness/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Happiness/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Happiness/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Happiness/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
