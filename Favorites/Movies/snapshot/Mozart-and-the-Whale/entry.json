It is sentimental, moving and has all the usual gushy stuff a love story should have. Nevertheless I enjoyed it. I thought the adaptation of Autism especially Asperger's syndrome was very well done. If you don't expect too much and just sit back and look forward to some light entertainment then you will not be disappointed. As someone who works with adults with autism I am disappointed this has not been released everywhere as it depicts autism in a very different light. I would recommend that everyone at least gives it a go. Probably best described as a \"chick flick\" and the fact that Josh Hartnell plays the lead probably helps.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Mozart and the Whale", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1152188697", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDk1ZDg3MGEtYWE2YS00NTA5LWJhZDctNGI0Y2ZmY2VmMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDk1ZDg3MGEtYWE2YS00NTA5LWJhZDctNGI0Y2ZmY2VmMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:26:32Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0392465", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mozart-and-the-Whale", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mozart-and-the-Whale/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mozart-and-the-Whale/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mozart-and-the-Whale/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
