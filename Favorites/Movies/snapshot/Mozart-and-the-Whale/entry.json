We kept writing the company and asking when it would be released. We met Jerry Newport at ASA 2 years ago (my son, Josh, aged 11 has Asperger's Syndrome) and wanted so much to see the story of him and Mary. As an aside, I wish you could have heard the conversation between Jerry and Michael John Carley on the various Beethoven movements...it was the most amazing impromptu music theory talk I have ever heard.\n\nAt any rate, Mozart and the Whale was in limited release and so we waited for the DVD to be out. Finally it is!! And we watched it last night. We were not disappointed. It was wonderful. There was so much truth in it. We saw the range of autism in the group that Donald formed. Then there was the quirkiness of the various people. But it showed the love and caring that can form among any person, no matter what the diagnosis. We loved Izzy's laugh...that HA! We know kids with Asperger's who can't modulate their sounds and sound way loud in their approach to life.\n\nI also loved the sequences about his living style. This is so much like my son....the stacks of stuff...the collections....the freaking out when his stuff is moved around....this is all real folks. And it is portrayed with a sensitivity and humor that can't help but to make you smile and/or laugh....not at Donald and Izzy, but with the cherishing of the moments that parents feel when they experience the familiarity of the moments.\n\nBut to me, the big question was what would Josh (my son) think of how Asperger's was depicted. Now, remember, he met Jerry and really thinks he is COOL. Josh said \"see mom, that means that I can meet someone and get married too, so don't worry anymore\". This movie gives me hope that a life of independence and companionship is possible for Josh.\n\nYes, we adore Jerry Newport. He knows a lot...he shares some of it with us in this film. Do yourself a favor...get this DVD and let's hope that Sundance will show the world that Mozart and the Whale is a film that needs to be shown.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Mozart and the Whale", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1152188697", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDk1ZDg3MGEtYWE2YS00NTA5LWJhZDctNGI0Y2ZmY2VmMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDk1ZDg3MGEtYWE2YS00NTA5LWJhZDctNGI0Y2ZmY2VmMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:26:32Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0392465", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mozart-and-the-Whale", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mozart-and-the-Whale/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mozart-and-the-Whale/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mozart-and-the-Whale/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mozart-and-the-Whale/thumb.jpg"}
