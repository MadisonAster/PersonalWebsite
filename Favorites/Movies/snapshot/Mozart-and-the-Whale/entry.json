My wife is \"Mozart.\" I appreciate the time the cast and other principals spent with real aspergers and autism adults. It paid off. Both Josh Hartnett and Radha Mitchell did a terrific job of capturing the spirit of myself and my wife when we met.\n\nRahda looks much more like Mary did when we met. I was never as tall as Josh but was much slimmer at his age. There are all kinds of whales and while Josh is a nice, sleek Blue Whale by comparison, I have become an Orca in my middle age.\n\nI have high hopes that an eventual theater release will enable this film to do a great service to my community and to anyone who feels different and wants a soulmate!\n\nIn order to not unduly influence the tally, I gave it a seven which is the current average rating although I think it merits a higher number.\n\n\"The Whale\" fka Jerry Newport", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H34M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Mozart and the Whale", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1152188697", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDk1ZDg3MGEtYWE2YS00NTA5LWJhZDctNGI0Y2ZmY2VmMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDk1ZDg3MGEtYWE2YS00NTA5LWJhZDctNGI0Y2ZmY2VmMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:26:32Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0392465", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mozart-and-the-Whale", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mozart-and-the-Whale/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mozart-and-the-Whale/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mozart-and-the-Whale/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mozart-and-the-Whale/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
