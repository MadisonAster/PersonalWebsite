It's a good concept and has a lot of potential but it doesn't live up to it due to the drawbacks of the first two films. The first film is a truly unremarkable run-of-the-mill zombie-esque feature which is lackluster and while it does get amusing with some humor at the end, it's not a great start. The second film, at first, is the most intriguing and sparks interest to see where it goes but it soon becomes packed with sleep-inducing philosophical monologues that will make you wonder what relevance it had of being in this collection. However, despite the first two let-downs, the third and final film is where Doomsday book really delivers. The third film has a bizarre premise and is funny too but for me it was truly the only good film in the set and there there was no better place to have it as it felt like a reward for sitting through the first two.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H55M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Doomsday Book", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3353066009", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVmYzExMzktMjI5Ny00ZDU2LTkzM2YtNDYzMTZkNjIyMDljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVmYzExMzktMjI5Ny00ZDU2LTkzM2YtNDYzMTZkNjIyMDljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailers for Doomsday Book", "uploadDate": "2018-12-04T17:11:04Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2297164", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Doomsday-Book", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Doomsday-Book/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Doomsday-Book/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Doomsday-Book/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Doomsday-Book/thumb.jpg"}
