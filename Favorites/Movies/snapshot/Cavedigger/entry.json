It tells the tale of one man's need to express himself no matter the odds. His artistic goals sometimes run counter to those of his patrons, and his need to support his family, and his own race against time and age, working in an art form that's incredibly physically demanding. \n\nThe documentary does a terrific job showing how and why this man is determined never to stop. He says that there may be an end to his need to create, but after watching this mesmerizing film, that's hard to imagine. For him, it's a spiritual journey, and Cavedigger itself is a journey into both the art he creates and the driven soul behind the art.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "CaveDigger", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3467422489", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MjUwMjY5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE3ODQwMTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MjUwMjY5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE3ODQwMTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An unsung land artist who creates singular, cathedral-like 'eighth wonder of the world' sculptural caves with nothing but hand tools, grit and passion struggles with unappreciative patrons, poverty, and his aging body.
