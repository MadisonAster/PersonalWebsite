The production values are superb. Beautifully shot in New Mexico, it presents the artists milieu as well as a look at the private life and inner workings of what goes on in very special man's mind. It was completely absorbing throughout. I was so taken with the sensitivity Jeffrey Karoff showed to the artist during the time he followed him around. I loved the the scenic shots of New Mexico as well as the beautiful presentation of his art pieces. All in all, it was one of the most sensitive representation of an artist and his work.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT39M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "CaveDigger", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3467422489", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MjUwMjY5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE3ODQwMTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MjUwMjY5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDE3ODQwMTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An unsung land artist who creates singular, cathedral-like 'eighth wonder of the world' sculptural caves with nothing but hand tools, grit and passion struggles with unappreciative patrons, poverty, and his aging body.
