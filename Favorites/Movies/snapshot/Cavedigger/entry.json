The title is just a teaser as to the reality of his projects. Cave is defined as:\n\nnoun 1. a hollow in the earth, especially one opening more or less horizontally into a hill, mountain, etc.\n\nThus one thinks of something completely different than the brightly lit living spaces created by this artist. Not only does Karoff show the creation of the caves, but digs into the life of the artist and shows his personal and business relationships as well, All this done with a light touch, that leaves the documentarian completely in the background without distraction from the main focus. Words are inadequate to describe this piece and you must see it to get the full impact of the enormity of this artist's work.
