I've never seen anything quite like it. My commentary for this film is almost all positive. First off, the cast really blew me away, each and every actor did a great job with their respective roles. Uma Thurman is a terrific actress and she was definitely the right choice to play the lead character. Thurman commands this role and you are transfixed by her in every scene she's in. It's not just the action sequences that she is great in, she's just perfect for the role all around. And it wasn't just her that I loved, I also liked Vivica A. Fox, Daryl Hannah, and Lucy Lui. They all showed off their acting chops here, especially Fox, I personally loved her short time she's in the film. The writing is well done, I especially enjoyed Thurman's dialogue, the well written dialogue and the impressive way that she delivers that dialogue all comes together to make something great. I think most movie goers will enjoy this acclaimed movie, as long as they're not too conservative that is. I say that because the violence is truly graphic and very bloody, but in a strange way it kinda works for this one. I'm usually not a big fan of that, but here it works. Good job Tarantino! 8/10.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Kill Bill: Vol. 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3102711321", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDFjYTYwNmMtY2YwMi00YmVhLTlhOTItMWE1MmQ2N2MyMDgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDFjYTYwNmMtY2YwMi00YmVhLTlhOTItMWE1MmQ2N2MyMDgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "CT #1, post", "uploadDate": "2011-10-26T03:31:19Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kill-Bill-Vol-1", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kill-Bill-Vol-1/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kill-Bill-Vol-1/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kill-Bill-Vol-1/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Kill-Bill-Vol-1/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
