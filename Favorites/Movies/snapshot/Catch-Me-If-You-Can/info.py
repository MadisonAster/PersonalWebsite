                          'the movie, and it only served to increase my '
                          'interest. Although it is important to remember (as '
                          "with any such film) that this is only 'inspired' by "
                          'a true story and not told word for word from one, '
                          'the plot is fascinating and keeps you laughing, '
                          'crying and wondering until the end.\n'

                          'Frank Abagnale Jr. is an astounding and interesting '
                          'character. The real life Abagnale originally said '
                          "that he did not believe Dicaprio to be 'suave' "
                          'enough to play the role, but he certainly does pull '
                          "it off. Dicaprio's acting is superb, and totally "
                          'believable as a man who could lie to, deceive, and '
                          'con everyone he met without once losing any of his '
                          'charisma or charm. Hanks is also excellent, he '
                          'plays the role of the obsessed FBI agent well, and '
                          'also with a likable quality. The interaction '
                          'between these two characters was great, it was '
                          'interesting to see a budding relationship slowly '
                          'build between two characters who were actually '
                          'positioned against one another.\n'

                          'colorful way. The whole setting and atmosphere of '
                          'the film gave it a wonderful and almost (I hesitate '
                          "to use the word) 'magical' sense. This tone "
                          'appealed to me much more than a darker tone might '

                          'one place (and identity) to the next, forging '
                          'checks and spending inordinate amounts of money at '

                          'millions of dollars. It ends on a high note for '

                          'wrongs he committed. Still, this would probably '
                          "bring the whole film down, and sometimes it's fun "
                          'just to enjoy a bit of escapism without being told '
                          "off for desiring such things. I mean, it's hard to "
                          'be totally strict and upright - you have to love it '
