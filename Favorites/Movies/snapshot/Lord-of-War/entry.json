Yuri (played by Nicholas Cage) goes to work in a particularly ugly world. When he says that he's had a bad day at the office, you can be pretty sure that someone has been shot or blown up. At any event, what I liked about this picture was that although Yuri obviously has some moral issues to wrestle with, he does so on his own terms, and we are left to figure out the rights and the wrongs. Since most movie-goers don't like to leave a movie with food for thought, this picture may not play very broadly in theaters, but I hope it gets a good audience on video. I also though that Jared Leto was wonderful as Yuri's tragically addicted and unhappy brother."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Trailer for this action film starring Nicholas Cage as a gun runner", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3548774937", "name": "Lord of War: Blu-Ray", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ2MzNhZGYtN2YyOC00ODhiLTk0NmYtZWE2OGI1ZmQxMTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ2MzNhZGYtN2YyOC00ODhiLTk0NmYtZWE2OGI1ZmQxMTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2009-06-03T04:07:13Z"}, "url": "/title/tt0399295/", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
