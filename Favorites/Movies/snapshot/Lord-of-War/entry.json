This is a very interesting film brought by director and writer of the film, Andrew Niccol (Gattaca). This is another great film of his that will boost up his career even more. Nicolas Cage puts up another great performance of the year and although his acting is very ostentatious, his narrating just like in The Weather Man, which came out a couple months later, is perfect. The dialogue is very good and the script couldn't be any better. Most of all, I clearly gave respect to Andrew Niccol, because honestly, he deserves the most credit out of any one who worked on the film. My hat goes off for him. Overall, great film of 2005 and I'll be paying more attention to Andrew Niccol's movies. I highly recommend it.\n\nHedeen's Outlook: 8.5/10 ***+ B+", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H2M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Lord of War: Blu-Ray", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3548774937", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ2MzNhZGYtN2YyOC00ODhiLTk0NmYtZWE2OGI1ZmQxMTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQ2MzNhZGYtN2YyOC00ODhiLTk0NmYtZWE2OGI1ZmQxMTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for this action film starring Nicholas Cage as a gun runner", "uploadDate": "2009-06-03T04:07:13Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Lord-of-War", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Lord-of-War/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Lord-of-War/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Lord-of-War/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
