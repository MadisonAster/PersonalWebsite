Apart from the fact that there's nudity, it has more uses of the f-word than any other film in history. Well, in the English language at least. It took me a long time to count every one of them. I counted 911, but there were said to be as many as 935. It is rather satisfying to see Carrot Top and Tom Green get beat up.\n\nSo besides that, there's not much else to say about this movie. It certainly has its funny moments, but is more or less not very interesting in itself. I couldn't get a feel for these characters or anything. It just seemed to be an excuse to be the most profane movie in history. Obviously, this isn't for people who are easily offended in really any way. The main plot involves a race of some kind, but it's hard to really care. **", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT1H52M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2380564", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Swearnet-The-Movie", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Swearnet-The-Movie/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Swearnet-The-Movie/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Swearnet-The-Movie/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Swearnet-The-Movie/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
