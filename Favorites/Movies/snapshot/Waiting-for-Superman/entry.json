I admire the format, and the presentation of the film, but problems with the education of American children have been a highly publicized matter, especially a few of the points of which Guggenheim presents. At times it even feels like he's stating the obvious, and even repetitious in regards to sub-par school houses he points fingers at.\n\nBut the film's strongest impact comes from the case studies of five children, who show strong potential, but their parents struggle to set them up with the necessary education, placing them at the mercy of lotteries that determines the lucky few who get to attend successful charter schools. Their build-up is near impeccable, leading up to the film's emotionally powerful third act. A third act that, afterwards, is complimented perfectly by \"Shine\", a beautiful end credits song by John Legend, and overall one of the film year's very best original songs.\n\nIt isn't perfect, but I'm gonna give Waiting for 'Superman' *** out of ****", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Waiting for Superman", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2518550297", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3NDMyMzE1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ0NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3NDMyMzE1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ0NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "This documentary follows a handful of promising kids through a system that inhibits, rather than encourages, academic growth, and undertakes an exhaustive review of public education, surveying \"drop-out factories\" and \"academic sinkholes,\" methodically dissecting the system and its seemingly intractable problems.", "uploadDate": "2010-05-11T13:31:45Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1566648", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waiting-for-Superman", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waiting-for-Superman/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waiting-for-Superman/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Waiting-for-Superman/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-06-30"}
