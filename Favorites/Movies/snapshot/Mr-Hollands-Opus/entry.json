Richard Dreyfuss plays the teacher, \"Glenn Holland.\" It spans 30 years of his career with a tear-jerking ending. Endearing characters make it a memorable film.\n\nThe focus of the story is Dreyfuss and three students he gives special time to over the years. A big subplot involves the teacher and his hearing-impaired son. \n\nThe students are winningly played by Alicia Witt, who plays the sweet girl who goes on to become governor; Terrence Howard, a really nice kid who gets killed in Viet Nam, and Jean Louisa Kelly, the last and most memorable student perhaps, an extremely talented singer who goes on to a career in New York City.\n\nInterwoven are some personal stories, particularly with Kelly's character, and with fellow teachers (Jay Thomas playing the most likable) and school administrators (Olympia Dukakis and William H. Macy). The most personal, of course, involves his hot-cold-hot relationship with his disabled son (played by three different actors as time passes.) Glenne Headly, meanwhile, plays Dreyfuss' wife.\n\nAs you can see by this cast, this is a well-acted movie with the only flaw being the screenwriters unable, as Hollywood seems to be, to control their political bias by giving unwarranted cheap shots to Republican politicians who are pictured as being against the arts; atheist John Lennon almost deified in this film as one of the \"heroes\" of the 20th century, plus a few more digs and plugs here and there, all with the normal Liberal bias.\n\nPropaganda-aside, it's a genuinely nice film about people who succeed through dedication to their professions. The movie seemed to appeal to a wide audience. It's very manipulative, but it works. It's also a plug, if you will, for deaf children and the problems they face and the difficulties parents face in raising a kid with that disability.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H23M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Mr. Holland's Opus", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi966459673", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjUzYTBiMGItNzEzNi00ZjAyLTg4NzMtOGU1OTdiZmM4ZWM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjUzYTBiMGItNzEzNi00ZjAyLTg4NzMtOGU1OTdiZmM4ZWM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Hollywood Pictures", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:20:27Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113862", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mr-Hollands-Opus", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mr-Hollands-Opus/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mr-Hollands-Opus/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mr-Hollands-Opus/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Mr-Hollands-Opus/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
