By the time we left, both of us were bawling our eyes out. This film is very touching and well done. Granted, there are accuracy errors (every film has those) and I've noticed several complaints about the music in the final scene (why are people so nitpicky?). I had a band director much like Mr. Holland when I was in middle school, a man who struggled at first as a teacher but soon became a beloved and inspiring director. Every time I watch this film I think of that man, and how he changed my life for the better. It's a movie I can truly relate to.\n\nOkay, enough reminiscing. :P If you want a film that will tug your heartstrings, this is it. Rating 9 out of 10."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Hollywood Pictures", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi966459673", "name": "Mr. Holland's Opus", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjUzYTBiMGItNzEzNi00ZjAyLTg4NzMtOGU1OTdiZmM4ZWM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjUzYTBiMGItNzEzNi00ZjAyLTg4NzMtOGU1OTdiZmM4ZWM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:20:27Z"}, "url": "/title/tt0113862/"}
