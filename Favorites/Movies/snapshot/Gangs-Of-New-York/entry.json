I am sorry Day-Lewis didn't win the Academy Award for his performance. He was just outstanding to watch. His facial expressions alone cracked me up!\n\nDay-Lewis played \"Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting\" he is one nasty dude. However, there are no real \"good guys\" in this story. The supposed hero, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a revenge-seeking man with a ton of flaws himself. The rest of the characters are either thieves, gang members, corrupt politicians or corrupt policeman. Ah yes, another family-oriented film from that kindly director Martin Scorcese.\n\nWhat Scorcese lacks in family values, he comes close to making up for in style. This is another fascinating visual film with great sets, costumes, color and camera-work. Other typical Scorcese touches are in here: Catholic-bashing and brutal language. (I question whether the f-word was used back in the days this film takes place.)\n\nAll in all, a tough film that could be too unpleasant to watch but for Lewis' outstanding performance and the spectacular visuals.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H47M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Gangs of New York", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2166859289", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdiMzE3ZTYtZDAwNi00NTM3LThkNjYtNzA5MjIzMTdiYWVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdiMzE3ZTYtZDAwNi00NTM3LThkNjYtNzA5MjIzMTdiYWVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "CT# 2 w/DVD Box Art", "uploadDate": "2013-05-04T04:13:30Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217505", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Gangs-Of-New-York", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Gangs-Of-New-York/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Gangs-Of-New-York/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Gangs-Of-New-York/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Gangs-Of-New-York/thumb.jpg"}
