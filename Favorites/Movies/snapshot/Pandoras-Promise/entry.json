The film doesn't gloss over the disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima; some of the speakers visit these locations in person and acknowledge their unease in a thoughtful way, but they also press on and discuss quantitatively whether people have been poorly informed about the actual dangers. The film is a myth-buster, which gives the open-minded viewer the chance to compare polemics with facts that the viewer can verify. The film makers take a radiation dose meter around the world, showing on screen the readings in capital cities, inside a nuclear power station, in aeroplanes, on a beach in Brazil (to which people flock for its natural radiation), near Fukushima, and near Chernobyl. Viewers who like me love numbers are advised to take a sheet of paper and pen to note down the readings at the beach, near Fukushima, and near Chernobyl. No doubt the main response to this film will be a brawl between \"pro\" and \"anti\" people, most of whom have not seen the film. They all need to calm down and watch this film. \n\nSome people compare this film with An Inconvenient Truth. I think Pandora's Promise is a better documentary. \n\nContrary to what other reviewers say, it is not \"propaganda by the nuclear industry\" - only a couple of the people involved in the film were ever employed by the nuclear industry; most of the people interviewed are genuinely independent thinkers, mainly environmentalists, with no hidden agenda, who have taken the trouble to look at facts and data, and who have been willing to imagine that their opinions might be wrong. This is a trait to be admired. \n\nSee the film, study the facts, then decide. (And, incidentally, I should say the film's photography is great!)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H27M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Pandora's Promise", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2888148505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzg0MTEyNzEyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTEzOTg4MjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzg0MTEyNzEyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTEzOTg4MjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A documentary about the history and future of nuclear power.
