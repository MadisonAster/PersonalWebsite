However, the MPAA ratings board still does exercise a certain de facto censorship power. Most people do not realize this. \n\n\"This Film is not Yet Rated\" exposes the arbitrariness, secrecy, and bias of the MPAA ratings board and makes the viewer question why movies receive the ratings they do. \n\nKirby Dick puts together a nice cross-section of directors and \"talking heads\" who discuss the MPAA ratings board's biases when it comes to realism, sex, violence, gay themes, and other taboo issues in films. \n\nDozens of major directors have had problems with the MPAA ratings board - they either received the NC-17 (or the old \"X\") rating or had to cut their films to meet the requirements of the ratings board. Some examples are: Kubrick, Tarantino, Lynch, Woo, Friedkin, Peckinpah, Aronofsky, and countless others. \n\nThis film exposes the fact that the ratings board is made up of people who are given NO criteria and NO training for rating films, so they basically use their own personal (and obviously heavily biased) judgments to decide what rating a particular movie should receive.\n\nThis is an important film because so few people realize how movies are rated in the U.S. Even fewer realize how problematic (biased, anti-democratic, non-transparent, not accountable) our system is. \n\nIt is also well put together, so it is easier to watch than most documentaries. \n\nI would have liked to have heard more comparisons between the U.S. rating system and others worldwide, something that was only briefly touched upon. \n\n9 out of 10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H38M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "This Film Is Not Yet Rated", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3958767897", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzgxYTliZmMtZjk1Zi00NGRkLWExMTgtMGUzMjExNDVmYjdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzgxYTliZmMtZjk1Zi00NGRkLWExMTgtMGUzMjExNDVmYjdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from IFC", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T16:57:37Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493459", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/This-Film-Is-Not-Yet-Rated", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/This-Film-Is-Not-Yet-Rated/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/This-Film-Is-Not-Yet-Rated/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/This-Film-Is-Not-Yet-Rated/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-06-30"}
