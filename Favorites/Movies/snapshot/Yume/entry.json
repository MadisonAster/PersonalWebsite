To some, it may be too artsy of a film for their tastes (what are you doing watching movies then?), others may be annoyed by some of the stories not having clear messages, or leaving questions unanswered. Well, that is because Dreams is a film that was born inside of Kurosawa, and lives inside of him, it's a very personal film that not everybody will appreciate.\n\nThe movie consists of eight short stories. Most of which center around the issue of   people's relationships with other elements that make up this world that we live in.\n\nThe cinematography in Dreams is breathtaking, and is the reason why some people claim that it is a film that puts \"Style\" above \"story\". I think that nobody can truly completely understand this film but Kurosawa himself. It is a product of his mind, a film that we cannot fully comprehend since we are not him. But since film is a form of art and in its truest form, a reflection of one's own self, Dreams may have just been one of Kurosawa's personal favorites in his long, amazing career.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi105028633", "name": "Akira Kurosawa's Dreams", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzg1MzEwZmItMDM0MS00YTBhLTk5M2MtYWJlNzQzYWZkYmZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzg1MzEwZmItMDM0MS00YTBhLTk5M2MtYWJlNzQzYWZkYmZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2011-09-21T03:04:51Z"}, "url": "/title/tt0100998/"}
