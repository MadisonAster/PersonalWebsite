This is the first Kurosawa movie I have seen, but I can see how true it is that Kurosawa is a master of creating atmosphere in a film. Such as the dark, post-nuclear apocalyptic world of THE WEEPING DEMON. Or the very first episode when the little boy sees something he is not supposed to see in the forest.\n\nI found THE BLIZZARD rather strange, and you'll see a scary part when the mountainman is having his mirage of the beautiful woman who symbolizes the snowstorm. I'm not sure what the significance of the dog was in THE TUNNEL, but I guess it illustrates the fact that though he was the commander of Third Platoon , he felt like a coward because of his command, his men paid the price.... yet he is guilty of still being alive; he's afraid of the dog.\n\nIt ends rather low key, but the last episode THE VILLAGE IN THE WATERMILLS is the most insightful and bold in expressing the movie's theme... of harmonizing with nature, and maybe harmonizing with ourselves.\n\nThe procession displays the unity and the communal harmony that the villagers have. And it is the exact opposite of what is grieved about in MOUNT FUJI IN RED or THE WEEPING DEMON. The cinematography is just beautiful. The movie is beautiful and captivating. \n\nAkira Kurosawa's YUME is Grade A- 9/10"}, "duration": "PT1H59M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Akira Kurosawa's Dreams", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi105028633", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzg1MzEwZmItMDM0MS00YTBhLTk5M2MtYWJlNzQzYWZkYmZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzg1MzEwZmItMDM0MS00YTBhLTk5M2MtYWJlNzQzYWZkYmZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video", "uploadDate": "2011-09-21T03:04:51Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100998", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Yume", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Yume/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Yume/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Yume/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Yume/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
