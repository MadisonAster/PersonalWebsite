                          "definitely worth seeing. I have to say, I wasn't "
                          "enthusiastic about watching it at first. It's based "
                          "on the great graphic novel by Alan Moore. It's "
                          'widely considered to be the best graphic novel '
                          'ever. Films adapted form great literary works '
                          "usually don't turn out well. The film also didn't "
                          'have a big budget. More money was thrown at making '
                          'Iron Man (2008) and The Dark Knight (2008), for '
                          "example. This doesn't matter though because "
                          'Watchmen surpasses all comic book films in terms of '
                          'professionalism. Zack Snyder is a good action '
                          'director. Just watch 300 (2007) for proof. With '
                          'Watchmen he demonstrated that he is just a good '
                          'director overall. He works well with actors. The '
                          'acting in the film is almost universally excellent. '
                          'Everyone gets to shine. Even Malin Akerman had her '
                          'moments. Not one character feels like a throwaway. '
                          'All this is further complimented by the good '
                          'choices in costumes. No one can deny that the '
                          'heroes in Watchmen look cool. The CGI is excellent '
                          "too. Be it Doctor Manhattan or Nite Owl's airship, "
                          'everything looks just right. Snyder staged some '
                          'truly impressive dramatic scenes. The use of music '
                          'is inspired. The score by Tyler Bates is obviously '
                          'fitting, but the choices in songs may surprise some '
                          'people. I, however, think that the songs are just '
                          'right. It was good to hear Bob Dylan\'s "The Times '
                          'They Are a-Changing" at the beginning and Leonard '
                          'Cohen\'s "First We Take Manhattan" at the end. What '
                          'made me like the film even more is its '
                          'cinematography by Larry Fong. The look of each '
                          'decade was captured perfectly. The 1980s are '
                          "somewhat dark in the film's alternate reality "
                          'though. Nuclear war seems close, and society is '
                          "sick. To all this is added the sweet look that's "
                          'also present in the graphic novel. There are many '
                          'images in Watchmen that are memorable, even '
                          'unforgettable. There are so many interesting '
                          "details that I couldn't wait to watch the film more "
                          'than once to pick up what I missed on first '
                          "viewing. Thankfully, Snyder didn't change the "

                          'book film for mature audiences. It stands above '
