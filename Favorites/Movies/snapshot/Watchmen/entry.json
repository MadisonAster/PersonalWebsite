This movie indeed came out too early.\n\nThis movie not only shows us the pictures. But also the people behind them. What I love about Watchmen is that it's mature and basic study of how our society is structured. There's so many quotes that can be used in todays world. And with Zack Snyders visuals. It really blends well.\n\nI gotta say. People calling this movie \"boring\" are the ones watching 4 movies a year. And they're all action heavy blockbusters.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H42M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Watchmen: Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3326279705", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUzODA1MDE3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzAzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUzODA1MDE3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzAzOTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "When an ex-superhero is murdered, a vigilante named Rorshach begins an investigation into the murder, which begins to lead to a much more terrifying conclusion.", "uploadDate": "2008-11-15T16:33:12Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0409459", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Watchmen", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Watchmen/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Watchmen/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Watchmen/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
