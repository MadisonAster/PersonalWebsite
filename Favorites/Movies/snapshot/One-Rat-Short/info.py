                          'the Oscars, though it was shortlisted. But it was, '
                          'to me anyway, clearly the best thing in the '
                          'animation category, and possibly of them all. It '

                          'beautiful. The music was perfectly suited to the '
                          'action, almost another character in itself. And on '
