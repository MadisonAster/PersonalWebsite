It is interestingly drawn and he story sucks you in and keeps you, but it is not appealing enough that I would want to watch it a second time.\n\nThe best thing I can say about this is that it held my attention all the way. The story isn't funny, isn't profound although it perhaps thinks it might be. It isn't as sad or romantic as some infer, either. I'm sorry, but I can't get choked up on a couple or rats who just met each other in a laboratory and are instantly in love, and then taken away.\n\nThis is another odd animated film, a serious tale about a rat who follows an empty bag of some snack, like a Cheeto's, that would have a scent that would attract a rodent. We follow the rat's interesting journey - which it is - as he follows the scent and discovers some strange sights.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "duration": "PT10M", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0818125", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/One-Rat-Short", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/One-Rat-Short/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/One-Rat-Short/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/One-Rat-Short/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/One-Rat-Short/thumb.jpg"}
