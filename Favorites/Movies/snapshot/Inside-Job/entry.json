The case was well made and indisputable by anyone of even modest intelligence, even Tea Party members. On second thought, maybe not them.\n\nEven though it didn't get the interview cooperation(duh)of many of the filthy rich top tier culprits who greatly helped cause the meltdown, it had enough interviews with second tier players making fools of themselves to effectively show how incredibly sold out some people can get when the chance for big dollars shows up, even high ranked educators and deans in some of our most prestigious colleges who willingly compromised their own schools' reputations for money. The film showed that they too are no better than mere puppets of filthy rich power mongers when shown the color of big money.\n\nThe indirect but overriding point made most well in this film is that filthy rich business people and crooked politicians are turning America into a society where greedy money power rules over anything and everyone no matter that terrible society-busting crimes are committed to do it, and that greedy riches are fast becoming the end-all and be-all for a growing number of unspeakably dishonest people, and that these sleazebags are uncaring about any fairness, decency, honesty, compassion, duty and honor that built this country into what it once was but no longer is. And, that Washington is a willing partner in all of it and that American citizens no longer have any legal protection or relief from their predatory ways that are leading this country into the abyss.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Inside Job", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi751502873", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTEzMTI4MjM4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc1MzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTEzMTI4MjM4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc1MzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Take a closer look at what brought about the financial meltdown.", "uploadDate": "2010-08-28T07:49:21Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1645089", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Inside-Job", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Inside-Job/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Inside-Job/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Inside-Job/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Inside-Job/thumb.jpg"}
