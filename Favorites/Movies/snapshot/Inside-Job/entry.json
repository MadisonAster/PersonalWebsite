Dividing itself into five sections of a 'report', the film looks at the background and effect of the recession and its effect on politics, the world, society, the economy, public welfare, education, the present and the near and distant future.\n\nInside Job is undeniably motivational and does well to extract the hypocrisies and selfishness of the main perpetrators and other persons linked with the crisis. Indside Job depicts the global financial from only one perspective and does not give due weighting to the alternate point of view. Of course, it does not help that the main protagonists involved in the entire affair are obviously missing from this documentary, a fact that is rubbed on to the audience time and again.\n\nOn the flip side, economics, being a head scratcher for several budding commerce students by nature, the spoken narrative of figures and key personnel could perhaps have been better explained with a clearer use of graphics. However since the film makers are not lecturers it would be too much to expect them to be aware of the concepts of pedagogy.\n\nWell crafted and edited, Inside Job is a good introduction to the cause and effect of the financial crisis, it falls just short of being the definitive version. It is a good watch nevertheless and provides sufficient food for thought and plenty of opportunity for future cocktail party discussion.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H49M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Inside Job", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi751502873", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTEzMTI4MjM4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc1MzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTEzMTI4MjM4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc1MzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Take a closer look at what brought about the financial meltdown.", "uploadDate": "2010-08-28T07:49:21Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1645089", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Inside-Job", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Inside-Job/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Inside-Job/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Inside-Job/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Inside-Job/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2017-06-11"}
