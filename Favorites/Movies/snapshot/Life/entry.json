This crew is made up of Dr. David Jordan (Jake Gyllenhaal), Dr. Miranda North (Rebecca Ferguson), Rory Adams (Ryan Reynolds), Sho Kendo (Hiroyuki Sanada), Ariyon Bakare (Hugh Derry), and Katerina Golovkin (Olga Dihovichnaya), and they're ecstatic to learn that the sample includes the first proof of extraterrestrial life. But the organism soon starts to grow and evolve at an alarming rate, and after a test backfires, it becomes hostile, threatening the lives of everyone on board, as well as those on Earth below.\n\nMy Review: The problem with Life is that it's almost too aware of the films that have come before, and it always feels like it's striving to be held in the same regard.Life just plods along a bit too predictably. After concocting a gripping enough concept, writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick are happy to follow the well-worn path of the film's predecessors, as six becomes five, which becomes four, and so on..\n\nLife is termed as horror but it is nowhere a horror.It doesn't even try to be one.It mostly depends on thrills of how the organism attacks its next victim.But what really surprises is its nail-biting,shocking climax which is the life of the movie.That particular scene at the end is spine chilling when we guess the consequences.\n\nJake Gyllenhaal is terrific as usual as it is a cakewalk for him.Ryan Reynolds is wasted in a small role.Others are decent.Director Espinosa,who earlier directed Child 44 (which is bad) did a decent job by unofficially rebooting Alien with a shocking climax twist.\n\nCinematography is good and BGM is soul of the film.Especially at the climax,BGM makes sure that we suffocate with tension.\n\nSo,Life is like an unofficial reboot of Alien with a shocking climax twist.A decent watch for its thrills.\n\nMy rating 6.75/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi376026649", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdiNjI5ZWUtMWZjMy00YjFjLTk4NTYtNjU5N2Q2NzhiMjFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdiNjI5ZWUtMWZjMy00YjFjLTk4NTYtNjU5N2Q2NzhiMjFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An international space crew discovers life on Mars.", "uploadDate": "2017-03-03T19:30:08Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5442430", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Life", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Life/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Life/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Life/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Life/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
