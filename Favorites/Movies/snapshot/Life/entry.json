One star rating? Come on... Clearly, you haven't watched enough films to know decent from terrible.\n\nI watched this film without having heard of it (no trailers, spoilers or anything). I'm a sci-fi fan and thought this was a good watch.\n\nI found the characters to lack depth and their actions were questionable at times but the plot was believable and the acting decent. Special effects were good and made the movie believable in my opinion. The movie was well shot and I thought the scenes with the creature were pretty cool.\n\nI don't get how people even compare this movie to \"Aliens\"; it's nothing alike. Overall, I thought it was pretty good.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H44M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi376026649", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdiNjI5ZWUtMWZjMy00YjFjLTk4NTYtNjU5N2Q2NzhiMjFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdiNjI5ZWUtMWZjMy00YjFjLTk4NTYtNjU5N2Q2NzhiMjFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An international space crew discovers life on Mars.", "uploadDate": "2017-03-03T19:30:08Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5442430", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Life", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Life/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Life/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Life/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Life/thumb.jpg"}
