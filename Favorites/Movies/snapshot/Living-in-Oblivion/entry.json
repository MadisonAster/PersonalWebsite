The movie plays around with reality and dreams without getting too obscure or serious.  It's well-done, well-acted (one of those rare movies where the entire cast is great), very funny and very smart. Naturally, this bombed...it was TOO intelligent for mainstream audiences and how do you market a film like this.  But it plays on IFC all the time and it's basically one of the best films of its year and one of the best on the art of films and filmmaking.  If you even slightly like movies, you have to see this.
