This affection is contagious; the actors seem to relish their roles and in turn many viewers will share the enjoyment.\n\n Indie stalwarts Steve Buscemi and Catherine Keener (who's graced four DiCillo movies) shine as director and actress on a trouble laden indie shoot. Keener does a virtuoso turn in a scene calling for her to perform the same take over and over, each time with less and less conviction.\n\n \"A Box of Moonlight\" and \"Real Blonde\" while having comic sides to them, also have much depth.  \"Living in Oblivion\" is an outright comedy; it's lightweight, but very funny."}, "duration": "PT1H30M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Living In Oblivion", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi111870233", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODMxZjg5Y2MtMGZiNS00NzE0LTg1ZDAtN2ZiYzM5OTk5ZGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODMxZjg5Y2MtMGZiNS00NzE0LTg1ZDAtN2ZiYzM5OTk5ZGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Theatrical Trailer from Sony Pictures Classics", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T14:19:55Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113677", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Living-in-Oblivion", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Living-in-Oblivion/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Living-in-Oblivion/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Living-in-Oblivion/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Living-in-Oblivion/thumb.jpg"}
