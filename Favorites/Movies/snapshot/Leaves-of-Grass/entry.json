And this was no exception. This movie was really, really cool. It had a good combination of comedy, drama and action all blended into one mix. And it worked out quite well.\n\nThis is not just a movie about weeds and drugs, it is so much more than that. Sure the weeds are a core essential to the movie, but it is also about family values, friendships, embracing your heritage, and coming to terms with your past.\n\nThe cast was phenomenal, especially Edward Norton, who did a superb job in both his roles. And the supporting cast was really good as well. Some famous names in the bunch, and everyone delivered good performances.\n\n\"Leaves of Grass\" never left me bored, as it was compelling from start till end. You should watch this movie, because it is somewhat of a gem in a vast market of endless movies.\n\nHighly recommendable.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Leaves of Grass", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi68289561", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMzY3OTU5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI2OTgxMw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMzY3OTU5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODI2OTgxMw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "An Ivy League professor is lured back to his Oklahoma hometown, where his twin brother, a small-time pot grower, has concocted a scheme to take down a local drug lord.", "uploadDate": "2010-02-16T10:59:20Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1151359", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Leaves-of-Grass", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Leaves-of-Grass/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Leaves-of-Grass/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Leaves-of-Grass/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Leaves-of-Grass/thumb.jpg"}
