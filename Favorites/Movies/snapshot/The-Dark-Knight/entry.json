And I was blown away at how beautifully done it was, the camera work, the acting, the story, it all took me by surprise. It is to this day one of the best movies I have ever seen or will see. No other movie can impact you in such an intense way than The Dark Knight. It is a movie worth seeing due to the fact that the workers put so much time and effort into this one film and they did not want to waste money putting up garbage. So Christopher Nolan, thank you for not wasting our time, instead earning our time with this film. To this day I still am anxious to see the movie at home. I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies in general. To anyone who doesn't, don't waste your time write bad reviews about this film.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Dark Knight", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi324468761", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJkYWJlOWMtY2ZhZi00YWM0LTliZDktYmRiMGYwNzczMTZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJkYWJlOWMtY2ZhZi00YWM0LTliZDktYmRiMGYwNzczMTZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Blu-ray/DVD release of most recent Batman installment", "uploadDate": "2008-11-05T06:59:18Z"}, "Title": "The Dark Knight", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Dark-Knight", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Dark-Knight/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Dark-Knight/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Dark-Knight/entry.json"}
