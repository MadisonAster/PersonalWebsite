This is the last movie that Heath Ledger filmed completely and I believe some how he saved the best for last as he managed to put an outstanding final act of a realistic Joker and managed to put a smile on our faces before death brings down the curtains on his talent.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT2H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Dark Knight", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi324468761", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJkYWJlOWMtY2ZhZi00YWM0LTliZDktYmRiMGYwNzczMTZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJkYWJlOWMtY2ZhZi00YWM0LTliZDktYmRiMGYwNzczMTZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Blu-ray/DVD release of most recent Batman installment", "uploadDate": "2008-11-05T06:59:18Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0468569", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Dark-Knight", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Dark-Knight/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Dark-Knight/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Dark-Knight/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Dark-Knight/thumb.jpg"}
