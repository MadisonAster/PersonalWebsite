The meeting took place in a beautiful house in rural Germany, where food and wine were served, and ideas were born.\n\nThis film is the best World War II era film i have ever seen, and one of the best movies i have seen, period. The cast is mostly unknown, but out-act any all-star cast Hollywood has ever produced. Kenneth Branaugh delivers an excellent performance as Heydrich, the head of the table at the meeting. He threatens people with a smile on his face, and barely bats an eye while speaking of killing thousands of people. Stanley Tucci is also great as the party-planner Eichmann, who set up the entire meeting, from the venue to the food to the topics. The way he counts the number of Jews that can be exterminated in a a given period of time is downright creepy. The cast also includes great turns by Colin Firth, a lawyer and professor who thinks the systematic slaughter of the Jews is bad for Germany's future, and Ian McNiece, who plays a hateful and witty official.\n\nThe dialogue is smart, funny, and chilling, and contains some jabs at all sides of the biggest war in Earth's history. This is a great movie to show in a history class, before watching a bunch of war movies, or if you just have an interest in the war. It teaches a lot more about the time than Saving Private Ryan (great movie too, but really one-sided), and features the best acting this side of the Godfather.---9/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Conspiracy", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2042560793", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM2YmQ1OTctZjhhZC00MGQ1LWE5ZmUtN2NmMzZkMDY2YzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM2YmQ1OTctZjhhZC00MGQ1LWE5ZmUtN2NmMzZkMDY2YzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from HBO Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T13:32:28Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266425", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Conspiracy", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Conspiracy/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Conspiracy/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Conspiracy/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
