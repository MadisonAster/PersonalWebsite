I have seen the film several times on HBO, and whenever it comes on, I feel compelled to drop what I'm doing and watch, again transfixed -- at the ability of our human brains to rationalize and deny even in the face of undebatable truths.\n\nAny honest person watching the film must ask himself -- How would I respond if I were at that table? How would I respond if I were a German citizen in the Third Reich? Americans, I believe, right now in 2005 -- should look at this film as a warning. No -- we are not fascist Nazis -- not yet. But the groundwork is there. The propaganda, the denial of the facts and the demonization of our enemies. The blind nationalism. We are at a turning point in our country -- and we would be wise to look to history as a reminder of what can happen when we as human beings let fear, ego, and the lust for power dominate over all else.\n\nI will buy this DVD and share it with my family and friends.\n\nAs long as people believe in absurdities then they will continue to commit atrocities.\n\n-- Bertrand Russell"}, "duration": "PT1H36M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Conspiracy", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2042560793", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM2YmQ1OTctZjhhZC00MGQ1LWE5ZmUtN2NmMzZkMDY2YzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM2YmQ1OTctZjhhZC00MGQ1LWE5ZmUtN2NmMzZkMDY2YzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from HBO Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T13:32:28Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266425", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Conspiracy", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Conspiracy/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Conspiracy/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Conspiracy/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Conspiracy/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
