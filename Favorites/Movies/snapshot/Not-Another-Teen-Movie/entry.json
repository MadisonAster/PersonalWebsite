First let me say that the movie has a ton of crude and distasteful humor which i could certainly do without, however no matter how crude or distasteful that humor might be to myself it is still neccessary. Why?  Because what i find funny somebody else may think is stale.  Granted most people find a scene where a toilet that has erupted feces all over a classroom is too much.  However maybe there is still the ever watchful 3 percenters out their that need a quick fix, and managed to giggle when they saw it.  So all i'm really saying is that the movie covers all bases(caters to the whole audience and keeps everybody entertained).  They have mild humor(The kind that watches cheers,cosbys,roseanne, and friends) and excessive humor(The kind of audience that only appreciates MTV's jackass,beavis and butthead).  Now that being said, I think the movie was better than awesome.  It was a single achievement in that it successfully made fun at every teen flick from the span of the 80's till today.  It was an extremely funny piece of work.  I am really impressed with the actors and actresses, because they played their parts perfectly.  Trust me there is no movie to date that even comes close to pulling off what this movie did. This movie damn well deserves a sequel, and i don;t mean straight to video either.  This should have gotten the comedy of the year award.  Scary movie 1 was good.  Scary Movie 2 was better.
