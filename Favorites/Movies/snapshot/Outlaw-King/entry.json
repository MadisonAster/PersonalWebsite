It had a few issues (pacing a bit rough in places), but it was otherwise very well done\n\nChris Pine is a fabulous actor and was believable the entire way through. I was curious to find out how he would handle this role, and he didn't let me down. The support cast was also superb, although I would have liked to have seen a bit more development of key characters, and a little more in-depth development of this snapshot of history, but by paying close attention, the viewer can learn a lot that's not blatantly obvious. The camera work was excellent, fight scenes well-done and realistic, music score perfect.\n\nI have to admit that I'm hard to please as a viewer, but this movie scored high with me. I highly recommend it!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H1M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi897890841", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU4ODY0MGMtNjczMy00Y2NiLWE4ZWUtNDc3YTc2MDhjMjAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU4ODY0MGMtNjczMy00Y2NiLWE4ZWUtNDc3YTc2MDhjMjAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The untold, true story of Robert The Bruce (Chris Pine) who transformed from defeated nobleman, to reluctant King, to outlaw hero over the course of a year.
