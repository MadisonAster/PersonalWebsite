After his father's death, Robert the Bruce (with a reasonable claim to the Scottish throne) led a rebellion, with multiple victories and losses, in battles small and big.\n\nThere are too many minor Scottish leaders who joined the cause, only to be slaughtered in the battles. (I can't call them cannon fodder - cannons had yet to be invented.)\n\nThe film is spectacular on the big screen, especially the large-battle scenes. I saw it in a 2000-seat theatre at the Toronto International Film Festival. I'm not sure it will translate well to TV, unless you have something like a 70-inch beast.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT2H1M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi897890841", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU4ODY0MGMtNjczMy00Y2NiLWE4ZWUtNDc3YTc2MDhjMjAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU4ODY0MGMtNjczMy00Y2NiLWE4ZWUtNDc3YTc2MDhjMjAxXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The untold, true story of Robert The Bruce (Chris Pine) who transformed from defeated nobleman, to reluctant King, to outlaw hero over the course of a year.
