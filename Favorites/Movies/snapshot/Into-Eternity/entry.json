It's a thought experiment packaged within a brilliantly paced, well directed, and aptly scored documentary. The subject matter is critically important to anyone with half an eye on the distant future, and writer/director Michael Madsen does not fail to put matters into perspective.\n\nThis won't be for everyone, since it doesn't spoon-feed the viewer easy answers, nor does it cater at all to those with little imagination.
