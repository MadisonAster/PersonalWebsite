Van Wilder defines the slapstick teen comedy of the new millennium. loaded with sexual humor and innuendo, Van Wilder keep the laughs coming. i believe Tara Reid was at her hottest in this movie, and believe it or not, there are a ton of quotable lines to live by in this film. as for the plot, its just about some guy who doesn't wanna leave the college he calls his home until he meets a girl that makes him realize his own potential. this film was much better then the last 2 American pies put together. this is a true popcorn movie to watch with your friends.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "National Lampoon's Van Wilder", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2644246809", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmRlNzQ0ZWUtYmU4NS00OGVkLTljY2YtNGNhOTQ3MGY4Y2FmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmRlNzQ0ZWUtYmU4NS00OGVkLTljY2YtNGNhOTQ3MGY4Y2FmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Artisan", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:24:43Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283111", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Van-Wilder", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Van-Wilder/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Van-Wilder/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Van-Wilder/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Van-Wilder/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-20"}
