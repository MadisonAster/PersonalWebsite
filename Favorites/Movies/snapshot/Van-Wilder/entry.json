The only thing that really surprised me about this movie is Ryan Renolds ability to carry a movie by himself, as Tara Reid has proven herself once again to be a terrible actress.  There is maybe one or two really funny parts in this movie, the rest just comes off as immature sexual jokes.  Overall, the good parts don't outweigh the bad, and I wouldn't give it more than three or four stars.  Wait for it to come out on rental, which shouldn't be too long."}, "duration": "PT1H32M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "National Lampoon's Van Wilder", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2644246809", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmRlNzQ0ZWUtYmU4NS00OGVkLTljY2YtNGNhOTQ3MGY4Y2FmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmRlNzQ0ZWUtYmU4NS00OGVkLTljY2YtNGNhOTQ3MGY4Y2FmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from Artisan", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:24:43Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283111", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Van-Wilder", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Van-Wilder/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Van-Wilder/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Van-Wilder/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-20"}
