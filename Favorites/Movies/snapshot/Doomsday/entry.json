I saw it in a criminally tiny Saturday afternoon audience (four people) and we all had a terrific time. Don't expect sense, great acting or original dialogue, just go for the kicks and enjoy. A totally deranged, over-the-top splatfest with hideous viral deaths galore, some of the best post-holocaust punk makeup and chase scenes since Road Warrior, brilliant use of 1980's dance music (Adam and the Ants, Frankie Goes to Hollywood--the placement of Siouxie and the Banshees' \"Spellbound\" and a Fine Young Cannibals track at the punk barbecue is simply inspired), a coliseum battle-to-the-death, a bizarre interlude in a Scottish fiefdom that feels as if the movie took a fast detour into the Shire, and the coolest star turn by a UK car since Harry Potter's posse made one fly. All of it snapping and crackling with so much kinetic energy and wild creative freedom that it's hugely exhilarating. We were still giggling like maniacs an hour after the movie.=) It's just such fun to see a director decide to go full-speed over the edge like this. It's not great art, but trust me, if you enjoyed Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome, Planet Terror, Escape from New York/L.A., and/or any recent zombie movie, you can't miss this one.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "duration": "PT1H45M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Doomsday", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1269956889", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ1NzM0NjkxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDYyNzkxMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ1NzM0NjkxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDYyNzkxMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Doomsday Trailer", "uploadDate": "2008-01-17T21:26:39Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0483607", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Doomsday", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Doomsday/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Doomsday/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/Doomsday/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
