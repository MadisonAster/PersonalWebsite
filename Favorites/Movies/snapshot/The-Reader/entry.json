David Hare's screenplay and the remarkable cinematography of the always remarkable Roger Deakins together with a sensitive score by Nico Muhly, this is indeed rarefied film-making. \n\nBut the actors are what drag the audience into this story. David Kross is amazing as the young Michael who has to play a range of virginal innocent to wizened and bitter. It's the key role in the film, and we're all lucky he was found to play this role. And the ever confounding Kate Winslet. What an amazing career for this young actress! Running through a list of her credits, she has some of the best performances of the last decade: \"Holy Smoke,\" \"Eternal Sunshine\u0085,\" \"Iris,\" \"Finding Neverland,\" \"Little Children.\" But here she does something very different. Playing what amounts to a monster, we see that they too are human. Not many actresses could bring this off, but it may be her greatest accomplishment to date. \n\nRalph Fiennes brings a continuity to the work David Kross begins, and there's a brief appearance by Lena Olin who commands the dignity the role deserves. \n\nI'm puzzled at the lukewarm reception to this film. I almost missed seeing it. And it turned out to be one of my favorite and the most heart-rending films of the year. All involved should be very proud.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Reader: Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1750597657", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxODY1Mzc4MzdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDY2NTMxMzMx._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxODY1Mzc4MzdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDY2NTMxMzMx._V1_.jpg", "description": "Post-WWII Germany: Nearly a decade after his affair with an older woman came to a mysterious end, a law student re-encounters his former lover (Winslet) as she testifies in a war-crimes trial.", "uploadDate": "2008-11-06T10:49:07Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0976051", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Reader", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Reader/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Reader/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Reader/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Reader/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-09-09"}
