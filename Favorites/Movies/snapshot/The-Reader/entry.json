Here, Hare writes another power house female character. It doesn't have the intellectual aspirations of \"Plenty\" but there is also a form of mental illness in his character. Kate Winslet is magnificent. Her early scenes with the wonderful David Kross are filled with compelling, contradictory and totally believable undertones. My misgivings are to be pinned on Stephen Daldry, the director. His sins as a filmmaker start to become a sort of trade mark, visible and palpable in the moving \"Billy Elliot\" and the shattering \"The Hours\" I can't quite pinpoint what it is but in \"The Reader\" that element is more obvious than in the other two. Maybe it has to do with loftiness. There are moments so frustratingly long and slow here that he lost me in more than one occasion. In any case, the cast makes this film a rewarding experience. Besides Kate Winslet and David Kross. The tortured Ralph Finnes has a couple of wonderful moments as well as Bruno Ganz and Lina Olin in a dual role.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "duration": "PT2H4M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Reader: Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1750597657", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxODY1Mzc4MzdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDY2NTMxMzMx._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxODY1Mzc4MzdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDY2NTMxMzMx._V1_.jpg", "description": "Post-WWII Germany: Nearly a decade after his affair with an older woman came to a mysterious end, a law student re-encounters his former lover (Winslet) as she testifies in a war-crimes trial.", "uploadDate": "2008-11-06T10:49:07Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0976051", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Reader", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Reader/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Reader/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Reader/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-09-09"}
