I see no reason why the gunpowder treason should ever be forgot.\" \n\nI've never read the graphic novel, but I don't think you need to read it to appreciate the movie. I saw the film last night at it's World Premiere at the Berlin International Film festival. Though it became a little weighty in the middle (one part seemed to drag a little) other than that it was a great experience. The story was so topical that I got seriously emotional during a lot of parts. Weaving did an excellent job with the mysterious title character \"V\", creating a poetic, intelligent, and compassionate yet ruthless character. Portman always seems to surprise me, except with her Star Wars character. She portrays tremendous emotional range and transforms completely throughout the movie. This is one of those movies that really sticks in your head long after you watch it though... and it continues to stir and grow.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "duration": "PT2H12M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "V for Vendetta", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4276093209", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWVkNmQ2ZjktZTU1My00ZTIyLWIzMTctZmEzNjQ0NTM5YzM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWVkNmQ2ZjktZTU1My00ZTIyLWIzMTctZmEzNjQ0NTM5YzM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for V For Vendetta", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T17:38:16Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434409", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/V-for-Vendetta", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/V-for-Vendetta/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/V-for-Vendetta/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/V-for-Vendetta/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/V-for-Vendetta/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-19"}
