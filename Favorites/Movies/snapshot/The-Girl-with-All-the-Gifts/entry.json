It's a movie about a girl... who happens to be a zombie... and her desire to come to terms with who she is, and her right to live in spite of it. NO it's not full of scares and gory zombie kills... that's not what it's about. If you can appreciate a good story about a little girl who happens to be a zombie then you'll see the beauty in this film. There still GREAT zombie action though... It was very well done, had an excellent cast, and Sennia Nanua shined. \n\nFull commentary WITH spoilers on YouTube/Twitter @moviebuffchick1\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wwm1nWFOwBI", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "duration": "PT1H51M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "U.S. Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3426661913", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1OTc5NDYwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjk2NTMwMTI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1OTc5NDYwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjk2NTMwMTI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A scientist and a teacher living in a dystopian future embark on a journey of survival with a special young girl named Melanie.", "uploadDate": "2017-01-06T04:33:22Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4547056", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Girl-with-All-the-Gifts", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Girl-with-All-the-Gifts/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Girl-with-All-the-Gifts/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/Movies/snapshot/The-Girl-with-All-the-Gifts/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2017-05-30"}
