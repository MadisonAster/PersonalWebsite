Genius is not equal to Perfect. It's a little hit and miss... and yet I feel it deserves a '10'.\n\nI think it deserves this because these guys (and their writers, natch!) have stumbled upon a wondrous land of infinite possibility. Not many people attain to this; which restriction is also an indicator of true artistry. From top to bottom, the produced sketches reek of talent and inspiration. From conception to writing to directing to acting... We are treated to comedy on blue-flame fire. It's head humor, it's body humor, it's slapstick, it's transcendent, it's bestial.\n\nIt'll be interesting to see how long ComCent lets it run.\n\nAnd, btw, I PREFER the new format (using road trip bits as ligature).\n\nHighlights: S04E03; Georgina and Esther (*gotta* watch it uncensored!). S04E10; The scat duel (brutally mocking and lovingly homaging the tradition at the very same time!).\n\nI'm looking forward to K&P continuing on an upward trajectory...
