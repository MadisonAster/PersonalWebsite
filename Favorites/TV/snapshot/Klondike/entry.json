Too many nonsensical story lines which detract from what a mini series on this subject could be. The script was weak, the dialogue was not of the era, the costumes were 21st century and some things just did not make sense or were completely unbelievable. Somebody needed to do a little more research on the subjects. When our hero fell out of the boat into the river, in the first episode, he would have probably died from hypothermia before the wolves even chased him. In the second episode our heroine could have reported the killing she witnessed to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police rather than let her competitor lumber mill operator continue to threaten the town. This series is a good example of how Hollywood can take a great subject and throw it right in the mud. I almost lost my stomach when the story line went so far as to interject antisemitism, race issues and women's suffrage into a show which I dialed in to be entertained. I watch TV not to be manipulated by the social engineers but to enjoy a good story. I don't think I can watch the third episode."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Klondike", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3498884377", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmM5OWNhM2MtMjFiNC00MWMwLThjYzAtYzZiMjdjYzY4OTAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmM5OWNhM2MtMjFiNC00MWMwLThjYzAtYzZiMjdjYzY4OTAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Klondike", "uploadDate": "2019-03-18T12:10:23Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2761630", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Klondike", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Klondike/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Klondike/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Klondike/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-08-30"}
