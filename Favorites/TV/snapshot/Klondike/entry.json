There are errors, lots of them, like wolves chasing after humans, very rare. Also mounties, or North West Mounted Police were not against native Indians like American cavalry, in fact they were incorporated with the intention of keeping American whiskey traders in Montana.\n\nThere was not a lot of killing as portrayed here (stolen from Deadwood), in fact very little as the Mounties kept it clean. The idea of the Indians being hung is a little far fetched also. As with all things like this, the mounties didn't allow any murders, etc. Remember, this is Canada, not California gold rush or Black Hills gold rush where killing and lawbreaking was the norm. Women couldn't get into a beer parlour in 1969 without a male escort. Yeah, beer PARLOUR, not bar.\n\nIn truth, Klondike was not even close to Deadwood in crime. Eh? But anyways, a nice 3 episodes, not very true, but what the heck, neither was The Butler."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Klondike", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3498884377", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmM5OWNhM2MtMjFiNC00MWMwLThjYzAtYzZiMjdjYzY4OTAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmM5OWNhM2MtMjFiNC00MWMwLThjYzAtYzZiMjdjYzY4OTAzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Klondike", "uploadDate": "2019-03-18T12:10:23Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2761630", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Klondike", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Klondike/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Klondike/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Klondike/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Klondike/thumb.jpg"}
