I was extremely impressed when they introduced the bicameral mind concept when considering consciousness. That is one of the more important concepts when considering the origins of consciousness. I hope they explore this idea in greater detail and especially its implications related to physics. It is rare indeed to have a fictional work undertake such a complex topic without trivializing it. I definitely have to compliment the writers for undertaking such a complex topic and I hope they continue to explore the implications.\n\nAgain, IMDb thinks I should add additional lines to my review which is ridiculous. I have offered a clear and concise review and they want an arbitrary number of lines, what kind of idiot makes this a requirement?", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "In the Weeks Ahead (Season 3)", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi361872921", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmZlMTAzZDktYTM2Yi00M2U0LWE2ZjEtNTIyZWE5MWNlMDQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmZlMTAzZDktYTM2Yi00M2U0LWE2ZjEtNTIyZWE5MWNlMDQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg", "description": "We all have our role to play.
