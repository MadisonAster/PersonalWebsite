Entertainment: which tends to either dumb down, or completely distort reality. And News: which is painted so objective and distant it gives no clues about the human motivation behind it all.\n\nVice is nothing like anything I've ever watched. It's a documentary of the extremes in the world as they are now, and they aren't pretty. It's not so much objective as it is honest.\n\nYou get a glimpse of how it's really like living in places and situations they make movies about. Suddenly Afghanistan, China, rebellious Europe, and small-town USA aren't mystical places where things are completely backwards. It's just people who live in circumstances that are impossible. Circumstances where you and I would do exactly the same things as they are, if we didn't know how things could be.\n\nWhat I love most about this show, is the rawness. It's not trying to be a piece of art. It's not trying to spoon-feed you with their view. It's just trying to show you how it is.\n\nIt's refreshing.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Vice: Basketball Diplomacy", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1933360153", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDRhNjM3MGItMmM1Mi00MDUwLWJjMmEtZDljY2QyZGYyYWFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDRhNjM3MGItMmM1Mi00MDUwLWJjMmEtZDljY2QyZGYyYWFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Vice: Basketball Diplomacy", "uploadDate": "2019-06-15T13:06:00Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2782710", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Vice", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Vice/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Vice/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Vice/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-06-29"}
