These people go to distance to show us how the world really works. Our planet is a very big and scary place, filled with dirty secrets, mayhem, destruction and what not.

He does not make commercials, he does not go easy on anyone and sometimes, an innocent bystander could prove to be more of a use than a scientist or someone who has \"official data\", as we know the world is filled with official data and footage.
