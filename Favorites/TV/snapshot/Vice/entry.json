If you have spare time, I would highly recommend checking out their website or youtube channel. The special on the North Korean work camps in Russia and their videos taken in Columbia are particularly interesting. \n\nWith that said, the Vice team really took it to another level with the HBO series. Just watching the show is invigorating, from the topics covered to the exotic locations to the people they managed to get interviews with. Everything just comes together perfectly. With all the amazing content found in these short 10 episodes, it saddens me that most of the Western world is more concerned with celebrity bulls---. \n\nDo yourself a favour and enjoy the first season. You won't regret it!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Vice: Basketball Diplomacy", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1933360153", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDRhNjM3MGItMmM1Mi00MDUwLWJjMmEtZDljY2QyZGYyYWFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDRhNjM3MGItMmM1Mi00MDUwLWJjMmEtZDljY2QyZGYyYWFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Vice: Basketball Diplomacy", "uploadDate": "2019-06-15T13:06:00Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2782710", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Vice", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Vice/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Vice/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Vice/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Vice/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-06-29"}
