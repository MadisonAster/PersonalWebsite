I believe anyone from mid teens to people in their 50s will enjoy this series as it has the type of comedy that anyone would enjoy, it says out loud what everyone thinks in their mind and in the best comical way. If you enjoy humorous more adult centered comedy this show is definitely for you, i guarantee its impossible to not like this show. Ten out of ten on my end, i'd love to see more episodes of this series if more people give it a chance this could be one of the leading comedy shows like the popular series \"Family Guy\"", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1701982", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Good-Vibes", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Good-Vibes/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Good-Vibes/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Good-Vibes/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Good-Vibes/thumb.jpg"}
