Aided by Dr James Blinn's computer animations and bookended by the very personable Dr David Goodstein, \"The Mechanical Universe\" presents physics entertainingly, but without talking down to the viewer, and covers everything from Galileo to Gell-Mann. You don't even need a science or math background to appreciate it--although the program definitely assumes that you have a basic grounding and interest in both.\n\nRecommended? Heck, this should be *required*. It airs periodically on PBS, or Educable--keep an eye out for it. It deserves a far wider DVD release than the limited (and unspeakably expensive) one it's getting.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0396993", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Mechanical-Universe-and-Beyond", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Mechanical-Universe-and-Beyond/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Mechanical-Universe-and-Beyond/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Mechanical-Universe-and-Beyond/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-06-07"}
