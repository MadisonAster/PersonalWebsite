Nevertheless, these documentaries are really well-structured, exploring state-of-the-art technologies with top scientists and not only they present complex notions in simple terms but also they are really up-to-date.\n\nAlthough some episodes are far more interesting than others, all of them are well-directed, well-narrated and in general well-presented. Being a scientist myself, I found all of them interesting and I would definitely recommend watching them even if you lack basic scientific knowledge. As aforementioned, the complex notions and difficult theories behind the science presented are given in an way that anyone can understand.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3163664921", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQzMTA3NDYzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY2OTgxNzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQzMTA3NDYzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY2OTgxNzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official trailer for Breakthrough from Nat Geo.", "uploadDate": "2015-11-04T08:51:15Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4622776", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Breakthrough", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Breakthrough/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Breakthrough/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Breakthrough/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Breakthrough/thumb.jpg"}
