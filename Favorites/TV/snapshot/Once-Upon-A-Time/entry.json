The way the fairytale world is mixed with the real world is beautiful. The main characters in the first season, regina and emma, are interesting and the storyline is wrapped up nicely by the end of the season. In the second season, there is a lot of character development and more fairytales are connected with the characters, again done beautifully, fairytales are intertwined, resulting in an exciting storyline. In the third season, new characters are introduced and they travel to new locations. This season is overall less compelling than the first and second season, and slower-paced, but still enjoyable to watch. Although the first half of season 4 still shows some enjoyable content, this is the turning point for the series, after this it seems like show was just going on for the sake of going on. Season 5 isn't gripping at all and it feels like they just ran out of ideas. Season 6 is a weaker version of season 5 and season 7 is just plain boring. Watch no further than the first 3 seasons, and maybe give season 4 a shot.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 7 Comic-Con Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3610294553", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjMyMzU5MjItYWQ0Zi00OWM4LTg5ZWYtYTQ2NjQxYWJkNzJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjMyMzU5MjItYWQ0Zi00OWM4LTg5ZWYtYTQ2NjQxYWJkNzJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the Season 7 Comic-Con Trailer for \"Once Upon a Time.\"", "uploadDate": "2017-07-22T21:27:10Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843230", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Once-Upon-A-Time", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Once-Upon-A-Time/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Once-Upon-A-Time/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Once-Upon-A-Time/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
