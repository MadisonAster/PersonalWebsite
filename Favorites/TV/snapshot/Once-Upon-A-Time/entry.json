Why did they decide to do a season 7 with the same story line as before, my brain will never understand. I despise season 7. I can't stand \"Cinderella\"s character or the actress. The character just seems so weak, without any motivation or attitude to live life or to act, which isn't how I pictured Cinderella. I thought she would be more rebellious and have more of a spirit. Don't even get me started on the actress - she has no acting skills, I feel like every line is improvised and the directors just went with the first shot they took. At least try to pronounce words correctly. \n\nSo please next season - improve acting, improve story line, be a bit more original, and get some good actors, seriously !"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 7 Comic-Con Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3610294553", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjMyMzU5MjItYWQ0Zi00OWM4LTg5ZWYtYTQ2NjQxYWJkNzJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjMyMzU5MjItYWQ0Zi00OWM4LTg5ZWYtYTQ2NjQxYWJkNzJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the Season 7 Comic-Con Trailer for \"Once Upon a Time.\"", "uploadDate": "2017-07-22T21:27:10Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1843230", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Once-Upon-A-Time", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Once-Upon-A-Time/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Once-Upon-A-Time/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Once-Upon-A-Time/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Once-Upon-A-Time/thumb.jpg"}
