Actors are great, seemingly off the beaten path yet somehow so familiar. Well cast with performances that are believable. I want to feel immersed in this world like I'm just witnessing what's happening, (you know, like with Lost), and they pull it off in Manhattan. It's hard to create a period piece that doesn't feel \"costumey\" or clich\u00e9, but this show succeeds in the details. It looks and feels authentic. And what a treat they actually know how to apply a cool soundtrack that captures the time period and the moment, instead of detracting or seeming corny. And they understand when a character or scene should just be silent, leaving room for mystery and questions. So boring when everyone just seems to be delivering their lines..nice and neat cookie cutter style...not so here. Let us feel the confusion, the doubt, the fear, the mess. Also love the way the camera moves through a room like you're walking with it, don't know what it's called but it's awesome when done well. This t.v. show...feels like a movie, in a good way. And I don't need big names either, just give me \"real\"....but seriously..Olivia Williams...does it get much better? All of the cast for that matter gel perfectly in creating this world and the storyline for me is new and provocative. I can't wait to see it and the characters unfold.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "First look at Season 2 of Manhattan on WGN America.", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1935127321", "name": "Season 2 First Look", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2015-10-10T09:43:54Z"}, "url": "/title/tt3231564/"}
