The \"Oppenheimer is a stoner\" reviewer must be high himself to write that besides Oppenheimer \"Everybody else is engaged in a horrible soap opera of sex, nudity, marital strife, alcoholism etc..\" as if that is a bad thing in a drama. Duh! It is a drama after all. If you want historical fact read a book burn-out.\n\nWhat the series premiere does is introduce us to a dynamic cast and quickly develops interesting characters and plot. It is shot well, acted well, and paced fantastically. Should be a hit for WGN...whatever network that is.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2 First Look", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1935127321", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3Mzk0NjU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ5MDAwNzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "First look at Season 2 of Manhattan on WGN America.", "uploadDate": "2015-10-10T09:43:54Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3231564", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Manhattan", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Manhattan/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Manhattan/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Manhattan/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-07-15"}
