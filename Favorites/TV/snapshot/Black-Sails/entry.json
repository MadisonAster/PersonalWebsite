But I stuck with it and boy was it ever rewarding. Season 1 was pretty slow to me sometimes boarder line uneventful. I know a few people that stopped watching after season one because of this. But Season 2 has been explosive. Probably one of the best seasons of a TV show out there and it was all due to the character development from the first season.\n\nDuring season 2 I found myself consistently updating my rating of this show. I initially had it scored a 6 out of 10. Now have it a solid 9. I can't wait for the next season. \n\nIf you are planing to watch this show. Stick with it through some of the long drawn out scenes in season 1 and you will be rewarded immensely.\n\nThis is defiantly another winner for starz", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 4 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2786375193", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwMTMwNjA1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgzNTEyMTI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMwMTMwNjA1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDgzNTEyMTI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Season 4 trailer for \"Black Sails\" on Starz.", "uploadDate": "2017-01-22T14:29:07Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2375692", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Sails", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Sails/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Sails/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Sails/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-01-26"}
