Of course, \"The Colbert Report\" and a few bits of the \"Daily Show\" are exceptions, but overall one must admit that even these don't really dwell too long in deep waters (meaning grave issues of major concern) like \"Last Week Tonight\" does. \n\nA couple of examples of serious satire from the first episodes are the death penalty, the hypocritical stance of politicians towards people like the Sultan of Brunei or even the fun'n'serious interview of the ex-chief of the NSA. The fact alone that such significant and highly debatable subjects are discussed is a huge win for the show. The end result airing on HBO, comes as no surprise to me. Their only commitment I have seen so far show-wise, is quality and creativity, two traits this show seems to possess.\n\nI am taken in by the first three episodes and honestly believe that this show has the potential to stimulate the brain and instigate belly-aching laughs at the same time. Hopefully, the creators will not take steps back, when possible pressure to \"lighten\" their material may arise - if and when a lot of people start watching the show. \n\n{Quick note to those who may feel offended by the approach John Oliver has on the ignorance of some people from the States, when it comes to the rest of the world: If you know your way around a world map and have an idea of what is happening elsewhere in this vast place called Earth, lay back and enjoy the sarcasm. If you can't do that, take the bitter pill.}", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver: Season 3", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3962944793", "name": "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver: Season 3", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQxYTJkZWMtMjRlNC00ZDJkLThkZDgtNzU0YzFhMjMyZTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQxYTJkZWMtMjRlNC00ZDJkLThkZDgtNzU0YzFhMjMyZTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2019-04-09T17:01:51Z"}, "url": "/title/tt3530232/"}
