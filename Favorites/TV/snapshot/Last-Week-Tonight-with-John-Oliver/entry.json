He's intelligent and sarcastic, and somehow manages to make topics that are completely horrific (e.g., the U.S. government's actions) not thoroughly depressing. I love how he will make fun of ANY political party; so many shows just spend their time panning Republicans, losing half the country as a result. Oliver must be a libertarian, because he very fairly simply makes fun of anyone who is doing something stupid, regardless of political affiliation. This is something that cannot be said of the unbearable John Stewart, or SNL, for example, but can be said of the awesome Lewis Black as well.\n\nI also like his way of poking fun at the U.S. - it's not condescending or rude, it's just good humored teasing. The segment in which he shows the globe with countries marked as Not the U.S. is priceless.\n\nOliver's topics are well chosen, and his take on them is unique. I greatly hope HBO will continue this show as it's the best comedy late night hosted whatever genre you call this currently on TV.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver: Season 3", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3962944793", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQxYTJkZWMtMjRlNC00ZDJkLThkZDgtNzU0YzFhMjMyZTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQxYTJkZWMtMjRlNC00ZDJkLThkZDgtNzU0YzFhMjMyZTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver: Season 3", "uploadDate": "2019-04-09T17:01:51Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3530232", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Last-Week-Tonight-with-John-Oliver", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Last-Week-Tonight-with-John-Oliver/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Last-Week-Tonight-with-John-Oliver/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Last-Week-Tonight-with-John-Oliver/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Last-Week-Tonight-with-John-Oliver/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-10-08"}
