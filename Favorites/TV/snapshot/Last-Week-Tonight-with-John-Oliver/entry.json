Stoners reminiscing about Half Baked can keep TDS as their main source of news but at least now those of us willing to hear a different perspective on US issues and considerably more (and better) commentary on international affairs can at least have a weekly bit of entertainment. Only advice: Jon Oliver's audience is de facto more educated than TDS and we do not always need to laugh out loud to appreciate a segment, John Oliver does not need to mimic Jon Stewart's fear of silence and desperately reach out for trite laughs and non sequitur dick jokes whenever something isn't met with gut bursting laughter; America has youtube and getting high while watching Aqua Teen Hunger Force for that; sometimes being informative isn't (and does not need to be) outrageously funny.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver: Season 3", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3962944793", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQxYTJkZWMtMjRlNC00ZDJkLThkZDgtNzU0YzFhMjMyZTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQxYTJkZWMtMjRlNC00ZDJkLThkZDgtNzU0YzFhMjMyZTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Last Week Tonight With John Oliver: Season 3", "uploadDate": "2019-04-09T17:01:51Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3530232", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Last-Week-Tonight-with-John-Oliver", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Last-Week-Tonight-with-John-Oliver/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Last-Week-Tonight-with-John-Oliver/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Last-Week-Tonight-with-John-Oliver/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-10-08"}
