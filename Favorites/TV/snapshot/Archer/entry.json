I dismissed it without giving it a chance at first, but then went ahead and watched it on demand. I am sure glad that I did. Archer is an over the top raunchy fest based on the doings of a supposed spy firm. You have Sterling, an insecure guy who thinks very little, does very many, and says just enough to keep us laughing...mainly because he is so stupid. You have Malory, an unhappy boss who loves an enemy, hates being Sterling's mom at times, and has shown more than once to be off her rocker. You then have Lana(L-a-n-a), Sterling's Ex who isn't over Sterling. She is also a no nonsense, ass whipping babe. This show nails it. I highly recommend it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 10 Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1934671129", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ0ODQyMmYtYzdkNC00NDNlLWIwNjUtYWI1MTI0NWY2OWM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWZlZGVyaWdh._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ0ODQyMmYtYzdkNC00NDNlLWIwNjUtYWI1MTI0NWY2OWM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWZlZGVyaWdh._V1_.jpg", "description": "Brace for the thrust.
