These sort of animated shows are good but old and don't change the formula of a successful show. They are all the same, a family/ group of friends getting into mischief everyday and each day is completely different but with the same people.\n\nAt first I though Archer was just going to be another comedy cartoon like Family guy. I thought it would be loads of random jokes (not saying random jokes aren't funny but Seth Macfarlane has been doing the same routine over and over) and hardly any story, but I tell you now I was wrong, so terribly wrong.\n\nArcher is pure brilliance. It's like James Bond became an abusive alcoholic and that everyone he works with are insane. It looks pretty and is well animated, it's full of funny jokes and most importantly of all it has a story line that runs through out the whole series!\n\nI love Archer because it doesn't have a new story every episode and forgetting what happened last time. You get to know the characters and see them develop as episode go on. The show doesn't shy away from changing things up, one minute you think that it's just an ordinary mission and the next minute something massive happens which leads to a character changing and this is who the character will act from now on.\n\nThe jokes are funny and always make me laugh and sometimes the situations they get in are funny. The character are horrible people, if you met them in really life you would hate them but in the show you can't help but love everyone. The show also introduces loads of new characters that stick around or return every now and again for a episode.\n\nI have loved watching every episode and I've just started season 5 which is insane. The best animated TV show I have ever watched! 10/10 Highly recommend watching if you like shows like South park, American Dad, Bobs Burgers, Robot Chicken and Frisky Dingo.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Brace for the thrust.
