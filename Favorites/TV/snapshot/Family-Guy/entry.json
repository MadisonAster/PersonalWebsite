As with \"Futurama\", scheduling problems made this show impossible to find on a regular basis. But it was worth hunting down - this show is funny, surreal, and offensive. Wittier than South Park (and more un-PC, too) and more original plots than The Simpsons, this show is hysterical. This show is also primarily for twentysomething kids who can \"get\" the references to Big League Chew, Kool-Aid, and that episode of \"Who's the Boss?\" where Tony sees Angela naked in the shower. I could tell this show was scripted by people my age, and that made it even cooler to me. I can't wait to own all of the episodes on DVD. Watch it on Cartoon Network as part of their Adult Swim line-up if you're uncertain, but you'd have to be crazy not to love this show."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "#3", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2124066585", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2MDc0NzQ2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUwMDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM2MDc0NzQ2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUwMDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch a scene from the \"Family Guy\"/\"Simpsons\" crossover, \"Simpsons Guy\".", "uploadDate": "2014-09-25T12:07:11Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0182576", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Family-Guy", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Family-Guy/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Family-Guy/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Family-Guy/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-08-19"}
