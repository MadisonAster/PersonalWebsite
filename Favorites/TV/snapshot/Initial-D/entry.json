Every morning he makes his deliveries, in his father's Ae86 ( Toyota Corolla ) passing through Mt. Akina's full of hairpins track. In the process of making his deliveries, he becomes a skilled driver and Mt. Akina his turf. Those who see him call him the ghost of Akina. When racers from other regions make an expedition to Mt. Akina, they come to know about this ghost. The Racers start to challenge Takumi and how he deals with each challenge and in the process becomes a legend is what Initial D is about.\n\nVisuals/Graphics: 10/10\n\nApart from the races it's just like what you'd expect an anime to be. The races have been done in 3D which really adds to the thrill. With each and every season the graphics have gotten better, stage Four being the best.\n\nStory: 9/10\n\nThe story is simply about the journey of Takumi from an ordinary High school kid to a legendary street racer and how he meets other racers who help him achieve it in the process.\n\nScreenplay: 9/10\n\nThere are a few flashbacks but apart from that the anime proceeds in one direction only. Nothing unnecessary has been done, making it an easy to watch experience. \n\nInitial D is a must watch, even if you're not an anime freak. You don't have to be ! It's much better than the Fast 'n Furious movie series, where they pull off stunts defying the laws of physics. This anime actually bothers to explain how the machines are working. Trust me, if you watch this you wouldn't be disappointed. The best thing is it has also been dubbed in English so you won't have to stress reading subtitles. \n\nOverall: It's a 10/10. Watch it !", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Initial D: Fourth Stage", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1827642905", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTMxNGY0MjQtYmYzYi00NDAzLWI1MWMtZjIwYzJiMjhkNjUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTMxNGY0MjQtYmYzYi00NDAzLWI1MWMtZjIwYzJiMjhkNjUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Initial D: Fourth Stage - Part 1", "uploadDate": "2011-10-26T03:28:36Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385426", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Initial-D", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Initial-D/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Initial-D/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Initial-D/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Initial-D/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
