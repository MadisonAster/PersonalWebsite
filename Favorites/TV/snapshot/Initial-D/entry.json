This is one great Anime, whether or not you like cars or even Anime in general, it's worth it just for the story and the memes. but nothing is perfect, so It's still getting 9 out of 10 stars.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Initial D: Fourth Stage", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1827642905", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTMxNGY0MjQtYmYzYi00NDAzLWI1MWMtZjIwYzJiMjhkNjUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTMxNGY0MjQtYmYzYi00NDAzLWI1MWMtZjIwYzJiMjhkNjUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Initial D: Fourth Stage - Part 1", "uploadDate": "2011-10-26T03:28:36Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385426", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Initial-D", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Initial-D/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Initial-D/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Initial-D/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Initial-D/thumb.jpg"}
