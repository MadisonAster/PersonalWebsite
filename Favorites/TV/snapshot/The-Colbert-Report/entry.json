He says things on his show that Jon Stewart doesn't have the balls to say for example: the \"Better Know a District\" in which he interviewed Jack Kingston.\n\n\"So you were raised in Ethiopia?\" \"No I only lived there till I was 2 so I don't remember much.\" \"What was it like being raised in Ethiopia?\" Just some of the stuff he says gets me rolling. He then went on to call the man an African American and ask how it helps him to be an African American in congress and how he helps the working class.\n\nI also love \"The Word\" which is basically a moment for him to completely tear apart the issue of the night. Always on the side are random \"pointers\" that always have some funny connotation to them. Overall so far this show seems to be a resounding success and I hope it continues down this great path. I still love the Daily Show and think Comedy Central did what the fans wanted. Many fans wanted the Daily Show to be extended to an hour so this pretty much is what they wanted if not better.\n\nIn the end the truth is that Stephen Colbert is awesome and his show is too."}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0458254", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Colbert-Report", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Colbert-Report/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Colbert-Report/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Colbert-Report/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Colbert-Report/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-08-19"}
