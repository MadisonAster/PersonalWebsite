So I'd say Stephen Colbert has made the best three satirical US TV shows. With Jon Stewart's Daily Show in fourth place.\n\nFirst this is a show that spoofs the stupid US news TV. With a segment The Word which is comedy GOLD.\n\nSecond this is a talk show where Stephen walks into a set where the guest is already sitting or standing sometimes in the dark. He runs in front of them and takes all the applause. There is no time for applause for the guest. Stephen is a one of histories greatest interviewers. \n\nThird it is an investigative reporting show which is more honest and insightful than the US \"media manipulated\" news and makes a genuine connection with the audience.\n\nI wish I could buy stocks in Stephen. Two word review: \"Thankyou Colbert!\".", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10", "worstRating": "1"}}, "url": "/title/tt0458254/"}
