Both the lead actors and the supporting cast were excellent.. Season 6 is Dull as Ditchwater.. A painful watch.. If they did this so that the hundreds of workers on the show wouldn't lose their jobs that's sad.. The show which IMHO was the shining star of the Netflix stable has crashed and burned.. Robin Wright is a great actress but without Kevin Spacey, her acting is insipid and boring to say the least.. For HOC fans, stay with the happy memories of Seasons 1-5.this leaves a bitter aftertaste"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 6: Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4155226649", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjA1N2EyNjctNGQ2Ny00ZjhmLWJkZTktYzYwY2VhY2Y2MGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjA1N2EyNjctNGQ2Ny00ZjhmLWJkZTktYzYwY2VhY2Y2MGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The final season of \"House Of Cards\" premieres Nov. 2, 2018.", "uploadDate": "2018-10-08T13:06:10Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856010", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/House-of-Cards", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/House-of-Cards/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/House-of-Cards/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/House-of-Cards/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
