However, instead of presenting these issues as they are, they alternately project them through the exploits of four young boys in South Park, Colorado. \n\nUnfortunately, many people take the show solely at face value, refusing to see the intelligence in it - South Park is admittedly filled with racist and sexist jokes, along with other offensive material. The problem lies within the fact that most people don't seem to understand the concept of satire and self parody. \n\nI admit that I, myself, was one of these people - for years I refused to watch that \"garbage,\" until finally a friend forced me to actually watch a whole episode, and I realized that the show was actually making a point.\n\nSo, if you haven't done so, go - watch an episode. You'll feel smarter when you're done."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 19 Teaser", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3609309977", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NDQ2MjIyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg3NzY3MjI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NDQ2MjIyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg3NzY3MjI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Teaser trailer for Season 19 of South Park on Comedy Central.", "uploadDate": "2015-09-03T08:50:48Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121955", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/South-Park", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/South-Park/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/South-Park/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/South-Park/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-08-19"}
