Well, three now, with different kids rotating in and out to fill the spot that Kenny left.\n\nMatt Stone and Trey Parker are comedic geniuses.  I think that people who simply brush this off as uninspired pandering to foul mouthed kids like the ones in this show aren't looking deep enough.  There is actually a lot of intelligent social commentary here - it's just masked under anything they could possibly offend someone with."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Teaser trailer for Season 19 of South Park on Comedy Central.", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3609309977", "name": "Season 19 Teaser", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NDQ2MjIyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg3NzY3MjI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NDQ2MjIyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg3NzY3MjI@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2015-09-03T08:50:48Z"}, "url": "/title/tt0121955/"}
