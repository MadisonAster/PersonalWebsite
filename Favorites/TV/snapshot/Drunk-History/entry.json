This is as honest as can be. And it's funny! \n\nThere are things only drunk people will say, and this show is all about that: what if we put drunk people's thought in a sober people mouth? Furthermore, what if we put it in historically famous people's mouths? Add to the mix a fairly famous cast (on the sober side) and comedy central's budget, and the result is deliciously funny \n\nIf the semi-incoherent babbling of drunk people gets on your nerves, if you expect some high level third degree intellectual Monty Pythonnesque humor or if you can't condone making fun of American symbols like Abraham Lincoln or Rosa Parks, then this show is not for you, but then again, you ought to ask yourself :\"what was i expecting from a show called drunk history?\"\n\nIn a few words, let's not kid ourselves and let's take the show for what it is: a funny idea like the ones you get when you're drunk with your friends put together by people who have the talent to make it funny. \n\nWell done comedy central, and well done Derek Waters.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 6 Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi120896025", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE3YTRlYzEtMTJjMS00ZjY0LThiMDAtZmEyNTQxN2ZmZDI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGE3YTRlYzEtMTJjMS00ZjY0LThiMDAtZmEyNTQxN2ZmZDI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "If you want to find out how Frankenstein came to be or whether John F.
