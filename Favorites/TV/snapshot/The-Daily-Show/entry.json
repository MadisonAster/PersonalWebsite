I don't know about the rest of you, but this show is a refreshing alternative to the shallow humor to be found in most of this country's comedy television.\n\nJon Stewart is an excellent host, just as all the correspondents and contributors are all great additions to the show. The show is a sure bet you'll get a laugh and it's a enjoyable way to keep up with the news without sitting through 24 hour news channels. Ha HA!\n\nRather than tuning into a predictable and annoying sitcome like saaaaay... Friends or Ally McBeal, try watching The Daily Show- you'll be glad you did."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Daily Show", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2072165401", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWUwNTU1MTYtYzY4Mi00OGEzLWEzMTYtZjhhNzM2Mzk2YzQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWUwNTU1MTYtYzY4Mi00OGEzLWEzMTYtZjhhNzM2Mzk2YzQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Daily Show", "uploadDate": "2019-04-22T21:39:19Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115147", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Daily-Show", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Daily-Show/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Daily-Show/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Daily-Show/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Daily-Show/thumb.jpg"}
