But in an era when lowbrow, kitschy humor and shock seem to be the easiest path to laughter, it is a pleasure and a blessing to have such a smart, witty, and insightful show as this one.\n\nNot to be missed."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Daily Show", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2072165401", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWUwNTU1MTYtYzY4Mi00OGEzLWEzMTYtZjhhNzM2Mzk2YzQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWUwNTU1MTYtYzY4Mi00OGEzLWEzMTYtZjhhNzM2Mzk2YzQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Daily Show", "uploadDate": "2019-04-22T21:39:19Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115147", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Daily-Show", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Daily-Show/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Daily-Show/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Daily-Show/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Daily-Show/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-08-19"}
