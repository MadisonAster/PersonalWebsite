Even without the volume I could tell that it would be a show worth watching. The first thing that I saw was Mr. Rogers standing in front of the train set going through his house. He called one of the stage hand boys to come to him because something was off on the train and then he took the kids head and stuffed it into a little lake by the train track and said in his calm voice, I TOLD YOU TO FIX THIS. If that isn't great TV I don't know what is. I just watched a new episode tonight called a piece of action, and it was just as good as the rest. I can't wait for this show to come to DVD."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 9 Comic-Con Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3905927449", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmViYTVkYmEtOWE3MC00MDQ0LTk0MTgtMjlhMzQ4MGU2YTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmViYTVkYmEtOWE3MC00MDQ0LTk0MTgtMjlhMzQ4MGU2YTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the Season 9 Trailer that \"Robot Chicken\" brought to Comic-Con 2017.", "uploadDate": "2017-07-21T23:36:42Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437745", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Robot-Chicken", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Robot-Chicken/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Robot-Chicken/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Robot-Chicken/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Robot-Chicken/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-11-09"}
