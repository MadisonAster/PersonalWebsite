What can I say about Robot Chicken? A lot! It is the freshest, funniest most original series I have seen in quite some time! I unfortunately know what happens to shows that are good and/or funny....\n\nRobot Chicken takes the look and feel of a great \"ToyFare\" comic and puts it in animated form. They were definitely aiming at the age group of 25-30, as all of the source material I instantly recognized; Transformers, Charlie Brown, Voltron, Thundercats....and so on.\n\nI mean can you go wrong with a show that has Optimus Prime dying of prostate cancer, or Cobra Commander, Skeletor, Lex Luthor and Mumm-Ra caught in traffic while carpooling to work? The humor involved is toilet humor for the most part....but seeing it instigated through these icons of my childhood, I found myself crying I was laughing so hard.\n\nI highly recommend this series to anyone who loves great ideas and doesn't mind crude humor. It will instantly click with kids of the 70's and 80's (Speed Racer, Knight Rider, CHiPs, Batman, Fast and the Furious , Mario Kart, Dukes of Hazzard, MASK (ya know...working overtime, fighting crime..fighting crime!) and Wheeled Warriors duking it out Cannonball Run style...all complete with a cameo from Burt Reynolds and Dom DeLuise!), making the humor and originality of this series apparent from the get-go.\n\nThis is pure genius programming (albeit only 11 to 15 minutes an episode), but with cameos by Seth Green(One of the shows creators), Mark Hamill, Seth \"Family Guy\" Macfarlane, N*Sync, Pat Morita, Alex Borstein and even Ryan Seacrest as himself, it makes the package that much sweeter to digest! Highly Recommended!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 9 Comic-Con Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3905927449", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmViYTVkYmEtOWE3MC00MDQ0LTk0MTgtMjlhMzQ4MGU2YTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmViYTVkYmEtOWE3MC00MDQ0LTk0MTgtMjlhMzQ4MGU2YTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the Season 9 Trailer that \"Robot Chicken\" brought to Comic-Con 2017.", "uploadDate": "2017-07-21T23:36:42Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437745", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Robot-Chicken", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Robot-Chicken/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Robot-Chicken/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Robot-Chicken/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Robot-Chicken/thumb.jpg"}
