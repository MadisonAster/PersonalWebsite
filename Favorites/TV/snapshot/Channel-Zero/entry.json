Because of these standards becoming more consistent it has become more difficult for me to find actually \"scary\" or \"creepy\" movies and TV shows vs just plain disturbing or shocking ones. Channel Zero (Candle Cove) immediately brought a creepy element into the story from episode 1 and carried it through to the end in what I have found was an altogether creepy, thrilling and actually scary story. SYFY knocked this one out of the park I cannot wait for season 2. Take note, Ryan Murphy- this is what a REAL horror story looks like.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Channel Zero Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2419570713", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVkY2Y4MzgtYjY2Yi00YzIxLWE1M2EtNmE4YTY2NzQ2NTE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkyNzc3NjU@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVkY2Y4MzgtYjY2Yi00YzIxLWE1M2EtNmE4YTY2NzQ2NTE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzkyNzc3NjU@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-02-27T21:24:56Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4820370", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Channel-Zero", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Channel-Zero/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Channel-Zero/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Channel-Zero/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Channel-Zero/thumb.jpg"}
