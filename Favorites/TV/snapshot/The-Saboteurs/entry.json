The production is good, both casting and filming are unsatisfactory, especially given the facts that the true history itself and the natural environment for filming have much more to offer than the final product itself. The worst is that, it drags too long. Te history/story would make a great movie, or even a long-er movie, but definitely not a 6 hours series, it's slow and filled in with unnecessary scenes that are not even enticing nor enriching. All in all, a bit disappointed, feel as if a good movie material got spoiled.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3280150", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Saboteurs", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Saboteurs/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Saboteurs/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Saboteurs/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Saboteurs/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-07-25"}
