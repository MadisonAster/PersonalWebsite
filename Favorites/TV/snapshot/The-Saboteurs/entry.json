But still, people had to make hard choices, and very often you were between rock and hard place, trying to see/predict a bigger picture and \"sniff\" potential outcomes. Kampen om tungtvannet gives a broad overview, through different angles and participants, of a successful, yet controversial operation (thus, in my opinion, the UK title The Saboteurs is not felicitous), with many real episodes and characters, performed by good character actors (more as a team, no one really sticks out unnecessarily). It is also to my liking that characters of different nationals were played by respective representatives, so different languages heard are always correct and without accent.  Well, the run of scenes is not always smooth, some of them are excessive and tensions are sometimes fading, but still - this series is worth watching, at least for Northern Europeans interested in the events during WW II not commonly known.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3280150", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Saboteurs", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Saboteurs/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Saboteurs/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Saboteurs/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Saboteurs/thumb.jpg"}
