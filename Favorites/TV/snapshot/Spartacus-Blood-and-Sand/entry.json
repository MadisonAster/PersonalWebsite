Okay, so the language is a bit much but the battle sequences rock and Craig Parker as a nasty, Roman lusting for power, just works! There's a lot of blood but the effect is cool and it gives the show that graphic novel quality that we've enjoyed recently in films such as 300. Andy Whitfield plays a very raw and passionate Spartacus. Definitely not a show for the faint of heart or those who are easily offended by blood, sex or violence. Should we really expect less given that Roman Empire of that time was brutal? Folks looking for a history lesson need to tune in to the History Channel. This show is intended to be entertaining not a documentary so if it is historical fact you are looking for you're best to keep moving. If, however, you want to be entertained by raw masculinity of the gladiator from one of the most brutal eras in human history this show is definitely for you."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "For the Dead", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi652322329", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1MTMwMDkyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjUwOTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1MTMwMDkyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjUwOTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch a preview of the penultimate episode.", "uploadDate": "2013-04-04T10:39:34Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442449", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Spartacus-Blood-and-Sand", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Spartacus-Blood-and-Sand/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Spartacus-Blood-and-Sand/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Spartacus-Blood-and-Sand/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Spartacus-Blood-and-Sand/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-10-18"}
