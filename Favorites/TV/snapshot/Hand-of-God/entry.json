Whilst you cannot fault the acting in the show, the overall storyline unfortunately becomes somewhat convoluted with a few curve balls seemingly chucked in for the sake of prolonging the storyline. Not to mention a few unnecessary side stories.\n\nMy major complaint is that the hand of God becomes much less prominent as the show goes on, it would have been nice to push this further with the protagonist. It seems more that the idea was used to draw viewers in and then once you're in they switched it to more of a general detective show. Don't be afraid to push religious boundaries and taboos guys, this could still become a great show if you do.\n\nOverall I'm say this premiere season has been decent but nothing spectacular. I wouldn't bother with season 2 if the quality stays the same, but with a few tweaks and polishes I may be drawn back; so watch this space.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3111368217", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk3NTFiNDUtYWRhNi00NzI4LTk5NGQtYzA1Njc2ODg0YmNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTU4NjY5MzM@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk3NTFiNDUtYWRhNi00NzI4LTk5NGQtYzA1Njc2ODg0YmNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTU4NjY5MzM@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A morally-corrupt judge suffers a breakdown and believes God is compelling him onto a path of vigilante justice.", "uploadDate": "2017-02-15T02:07:42Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3973768", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Hand-of-God", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Hand-of-God/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Hand-of-God/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Hand-of-God/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Hand-of-God/thumb.jpg"}
