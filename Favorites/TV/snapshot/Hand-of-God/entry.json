Of course, no show is right for every one, that is why we has thousands of different shows to watch but for me, this was a great show. Continued to keep my attention and made me want to watch the next episode immediately. Wonderful work from Ron Perlman and Dana Delaney (and I'm not a huge fan of hers). The supporting cast were very good as well.\n\nI will admit there are parts of the show that drift off, are derivative and just all-around don't make sense, but those are small. In the end, the show is compelling, interesting and an excellent series.\n\nIt's a shame, there will be no season 3, it deserves it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3111368217", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk3NTFiNDUtYWRhNi00NzI4LTk5NGQtYzA1Njc2ODg0YmNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTU4NjY5MzM@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk3NTFiNDUtYWRhNi00NzI4LTk5NGQtYzA1Njc2ODg0YmNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTU4NjY5MzM@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A morally-corrupt judge suffers a breakdown and believes God is compelling him onto a path of vigilante justice.", "uploadDate": "2017-02-15T02:07:42Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3973768", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Hand-of-God", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Hand-of-God/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Hand-of-God/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Hand-of-God/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Hand-of-God/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-09-07"}
