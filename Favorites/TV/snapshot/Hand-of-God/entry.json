Even just one of the best pilots all around. \n\nActing is very convincing from all of the leads. The story is very engaging and keeps you on the edge. It makes you question the main character's sanity, but still sympathize with him. There're a lot of layers to the narrative, but it feels all connected. \n\nMarc Foster and Ben Watkins delivered! \n\nI sincerely hope that Amazon will pick it up and produce the whole season with the same outstanding quality.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3111368217", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk3NTFiNDUtYWRhNi00NzI4LTk5NGQtYzA1Njc2ODg0YmNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTU4NjY5MzM@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk3NTFiNDUtYWRhNi00NzI4LTk5NGQtYzA1Njc2ODg0YmNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTU4NjY5MzM@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A morally-corrupt judge suffers a breakdown and believes God is compelling him onto a path of vigilante justice.", "uploadDate": "2017-02-15T02:07:42Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3973768", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Hand-of-God", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Hand-of-God/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Hand-of-God/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Hand-of-God/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-09-07"}
