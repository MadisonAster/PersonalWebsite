Barrymore and Olyphant have great chemistry and are believable as a long married wife and husband. The actress who plays their teenage daughter is great as well because she isn't on either end of the annoying teenager on TV scale. Instead she reacts convincingly like you would believe a teenager would in (an admittingly) an unusual situation like she finds herself in. \n\nOf course this show won't be to everyones....uhhh appetite. It plays murder and cannibalism for laughs and those with a weak stomach and ears that bleed at cussing will get turned away pretty quickly. However this is a genuinely sweet and funny comedy about what it means to be a family and the lengths people will go to protect the lives and loves they have.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "True love never dies? \"Santa Clarita Diet\" Season 3 is coming March 29.", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4031429145", "name": "Season 3 Trailer", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y4NjFhMDUtNWQyYS00ZjFjLTlkYTYtZDU0ZTZjNTI2OTIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y4NjFhMDUtNWQyYS00ZjFjLTlkYTYtZDU0ZTZjNTI2OTIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2019-03-11T20:04:11Z"}, "url": "/title/tt5580540/"}
