I think the dry, real, banal, hilarious, humor is amazing. Best thing on TV since the Simpsons and Family Guy! Bravo! I can't wait for more! These writers and actors have nailed a reality like no others. I love the take it on the chin frustration. Right on. If you don't get it...you don't get it. If you do you know \"its people\"! i was convinced from the trailers that I would like it and I did. I waited for weeks for this show to come on, then when it did I was out of town and had to catch it on Hulu.com, fortunately. Great work Fox! I think if the network doesn't get the response they need or want there will be a huge following on the web."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Bob's Burgers: Series Premiere", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3450714137", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVmYzcxMWQtM2MyZS00YTE3LWFkMDItYWFiMTJjNmFiMTg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVmYzcxMWQtM2MyZS00YTE3LWFkMDItYWFiMTJjNmFiMTg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Series Trailer for Bob's Burgers", "uploadDate": "2017-12-05T16:02:58Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1561755", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Bobs-Burgers", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Bobs-Burgers/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Bobs-Burgers/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Bobs-Burgers/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-01-26"}
