I have never fallen in love with a television show as quickly as I have with this one.\n\nThe humor is original, fresh, and it completely helps push the plot of each show along instead of throwing in humor that is completely unrelated to the plot. There is no comparison between this show and other animated comedies on television currently. Family Guy, The Simpsons, and other shows on TV now are re-using jokes and going for the easy laugh with sex jokes, but Bob's Burgers has smart comedy that often hits you a few minutes later. The characters are all so different, quirky, and lovable! I can see the typical family dynamic and it depicts families as they are. I love it. This show is great and I hope it keeps going!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Bob's Burgers: Series Premiere", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3450714137", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVmYzcxMWQtM2MyZS00YTE3LWFkMDItYWFiMTJjNmFiMTg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVmYzcxMWQtM2MyZS00YTE3LWFkMDItYWFiMTJjNmFiMTg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Series Trailer for Bob's Burgers", "uploadDate": "2017-12-05T16:02:58Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1561755", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Bobs-Burgers", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Bobs-Burgers/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Bobs-Burgers/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Bobs-Burgers/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Bobs-Burgers/thumb.jpg"}
