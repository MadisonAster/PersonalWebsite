The pilot starts up very slow but builds suspense as it starts to tell the story, and that's where it shines; in it's storytelling. It was dramatically convincing and had a pleasantly dark atmosphere.\n\nThe pilot was very long (1hr 20min) but it felt much shorter, it was tense from start to finish, in the sense of the story it was actually very predictable, but it was the acting and how the story was portrayed that made it so gripping and watchable. Not a second went by where my attention wasn't glued to the TV screen. \n\nWhat really made me love the pilot was how REAL the story felt, there wasn't a moment that made me think that it was a stupid story, it felt REAL. The acting was superb by everyone, the cinematography was perfect with it's overall dark tone and lighting, and the music just set the scene playing in the background to the tone of the show.\n\nThe overall mood of the show has been set for the series, and if it stays at this standard for the rest of the series it will be an ultimate success. I look forward to where the rest of this series takes us! No complaints yet!\n\n9/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Tonight 9 p.m.", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2516104985", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMjA5MzY1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI4MzczOTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYxMjA5MzY1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI4MzczOTE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "After a night of partying with a female stranger, a man wakes up to find her stabbed to death and is charged with her murder.", "uploadDate": "2016-07-08T00:40:05Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2401256", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Night-Of", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Night-Of/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Night-Of/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Night-Of/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Night-Of/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2016-09-03"}
