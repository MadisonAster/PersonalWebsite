Like many of these mockumentary style shows or sitcoms they often start off a little slowly. (Not that this show could be described as a mockumentary as such)However, this review comes after episode 3 (Love) which is the best episode so far and I'm already falling in love with all the main characters. \n\nIt has been said often of Legit that it has heart, it certainly does, it has oodles of soul perfectly balanced with gut busting laughter.\n\nReminiscent of Curb your Enthusiasm Legit is cringe-worthy more often than not but you wont be able to look away. A bit like Parks & Rec it started slowly but didn't take long for me to feel great empathy for the main cast, you really want these guys to succeed. \n\nIts a little to early to dissect the characters, suffice it to say, Jim Jefferies' TV packaged portrayal of himself is a little out of step with the Jim Jefferies you'll experience on stage. Albeit the Jim in the TV show seems like a bit of a narcissist and/or sociopath to some extent, slowly going legit and becoming more empathic, which I suppose is the point of the somewhat vague premise. Nevertheless, it still works and it's fair to say the guy can act, He's no DJ Qualls in the acting department but I would give him a robust 7/10 notwithstanding.\n\nJim manages to deliver his brand of shock value comedy, vulgarity and twisted tales without the unrelenting barrage of epithets and I think its a credit to him.\n\nIt goes without saying that Legit will not be for everyone, Jim Jefferies is not considered one of the top dirty stand up comics for no reason.\n\nI'm not sure where this show is headed nor could I say it has much longevity but I'm going to enjoy the ride while it lasts. Why don't you join me.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Legit: The Complete First Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1912580889", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWZiZDYxZDAtN2VjZS00YzY4LTk3N2UtNGRjZDk1YmNmOTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWZiZDYxZDAtN2VjZS00YzY4LTk3N2UtNGRjZDk1YmNmOTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Legit: The Complete First Season", "uploadDate": "2014-02-16T07:39:09Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2400391", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Legit", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Legit/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Legit/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Legit/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Legit/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-12-27"}
