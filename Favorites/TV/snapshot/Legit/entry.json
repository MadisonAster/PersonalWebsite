The first episode is already funny, but I was a little hesitant about how they were planning out how to work with the other two characters, but that works brilliantly. Very funny, very nice to watch, it is something new, not more of the same. I hope this will catch on quickly, because I do not want to see this series fail. I do not know why you need ten lines, but OK. I will accept that this is necessary. If you want to know what my taste in shows is, then look below. It will be a summation of the shows I like. Just to know where to put my opinion.\n\nDexter Breaking Bad Mad Men Boardwalk Empire Suits The Walking dead House of Lies Workaholics HIMYM The Big Bang theory Two and a half men Happy Endings", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Trailer for Legit: The Complete First Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1912580889", "name": "Legit: The Complete First Season", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWZiZDYxZDAtN2VjZS00YzY4LTk3N2UtNGRjZDk1YmNmOTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWZiZDYxZDAtN2VjZS00YzY4LTk3N2UtNGRjZDk1YmNmOTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2014-02-16T07:39:09Z"}, "url": "/title/tt2400391/", "EntryAdded": "2013-12-27"}
