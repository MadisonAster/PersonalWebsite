I'm not familiar with Jim Jeffries' comedy... Maybe that is a good thing, but this show is hilarious! If you want to see \"masterful acting\" go see Les Miserables or some crap like that. Wanna see funny? Watch this! No, it's not for the kiddies, but I just watched it on a Thursday night at about 10 PM. Responsible parents already have their kiddies tucked in bed by then, so if little Jane or Johnny is still up, don't blame TV programming for any problems. It might be obnoxious humor to some and if strong language offends you then perhaps it's best that you skip this show. As for me, I will check the schedule and eagerly await the next episode.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Legit: The Complete First Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1912580889", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWZiZDYxZDAtN2VjZS00YzY4LTk3N2UtNGRjZDk1YmNmOTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWZiZDYxZDAtN2VjZS00YzY4LTk3N2UtNGRjZDk1YmNmOTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Legit: The Complete First Season", "uploadDate": "2014-02-16T07:39:09Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2400391", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Legit", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Legit/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Legit/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Legit/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-12-27"}
