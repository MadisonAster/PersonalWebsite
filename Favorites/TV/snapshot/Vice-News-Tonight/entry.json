I augment that with headlines from online newspapers. I love the global stories and the unique perspective this show brings. It has a stellar cast of correspondents -- I particularly enjoy news stories from Arielle, Ben, Dexter, Elle, Evan, Gianna, Hind Isobel, Thomas, and Krishna. But most of all I like the no-nonsense interviews by Michael Moynihan, love how he does not pander no matter what. I hope he gets his own show down the line! The only thing I dislike are the segments about musicians talking about their songs/music...I cannot stand these, most annoying/narcissistic group of people (next to politicians) I've ever seen who just love to talk about themselves. I hope that segment is killed off over time, may be that can be part of another show? Thank you for keeping this series going HBO and keep up the excellent work team!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6329790", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Vice-News-Tonight", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Vice-News-Tonight/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Vice-News-Tonight/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Vice-News-Tonight/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Vice-News-Tonight/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
