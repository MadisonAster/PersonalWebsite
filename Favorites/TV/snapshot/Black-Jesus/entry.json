Regardless of the uptight people who've been criticizing the bold and the funny since GTA was a top down game, this show is a hit. I honestly can't figure out what they're more offended by considering many shows have made fun of Jesus and in this case I believe the race-card may be justified. This show is hilarious and has a great cast. What if Jesus smoked hemp and was Black? We don't know and in this day and age it's not uncommon for satire to be made from this. Regardless of what he does, Black Jesus still teaches love. Adult swim rarely gets live-action shows that I like, this one I enjoy thoroughly. If you cant handle the fact the television \"goes there\" nowadays turn the set off.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2295180313", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM4Njg2MzU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUzNDgyMjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM4Njg2MzU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUzNDgyMjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A TV series finds Jesus living in present day Compton, CA on a daily mission to spread love and kindness throughout the neighborhood with the help of his small but loyal group of downtrodden followers.", "uploadDate": "2014-07-25T08:48:39Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3589872", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Jesus", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Jesus/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Jesus/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Jesus/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Jesus/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-08-08"}
