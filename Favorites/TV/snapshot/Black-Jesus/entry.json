It's a standard pilot, introduction of important characters and letting us know a piece of their person lives and problems. I do feel that the show would better benefit from a 45 - and an 1hr time slot. At 22 minutes the show felt a little rushed, but i suppose in time I will get used to it.Some might complain of the stereotypes portrayed here, but none of them are completely unbelievable or \"cartoonish\" or even insulting in nature. What we have here is a show that obviously means well and doesn't even disrespect its \"source material\" if you can call it that. Of course, Black Jesus does curse like a sailor...which is one of the shows charms. Knowing McGruder's past work I can confidently say that this show is in good hands and i predict nothing but greatness before the end of the first season.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "A TV series finds Jesus living in present day Compton, CA on a daily mission to spread love and kindness throughout the neighborhood with the help of his small but loyal group of downtrodden followers.", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2295180313", "name": "Official Trailer", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM4Njg2MzU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUzNDgyMjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM4Njg2MzU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUzNDgyMjE@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2014-07-25T08:48:39Z"}, "url": "/title/tt3589872/", "EntryAdded": "2014-08-08"}
