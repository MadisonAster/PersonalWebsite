It's humor isn't for everyone, but you can tell unlike some Live Action Adult Swim Shows, this one has effort in the writing, the casting, and uses the Location to it's fullest. It was a good Pilot that made me want to see more.\n\nIt's a good way to show that it's OK to laugh at certain things, especially Religion. Black Jesus is Harmless, and I will continue to watch it. I think if Jesus Christ were here, he'd learn to take a good rib at himself, so other people should too. People will still complain and say negative things, but I will just take it as what it is, something that can be enjoyed, laughed at, and not taken in a harmful way. It's not a show meant to attack religions, it's not a show meant for Children clearly, so in the end, it's just harmless fun to me.\n\nSmoke, Drink, Chill, and don't get so worked up over it. Black Jesus is a Comedy I can't wait to see more of.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2295180313", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM4Njg2MzU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUzNDgyMjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM4Njg2MzU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDUzNDgyMjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A TV series finds Jesus living in present day Compton, CA on a daily mission to spread love and kindness throughout the neighborhood with the help of his small but loyal group of downtrodden followers.", "uploadDate": "2014-07-25T08:48:39Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3589872", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Jesus", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Jesus/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Jesus/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Jesus/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-08-08"}
