When you do understand all the characters, besides being very entertaining and delightful to watch, it is going to blow your mind sometimes.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Office: The Complete Series", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2686888217", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDczMWVjNWUtY2FiMC00MjUwLWIzZTItMTNiNTE2MWUzN2I5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDczMWVjNWUtY2FiMC00MjUwLWIzZTItMTNiNTE2MWUzN2I5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for The Office: The Complete Series", "uploadDate": "2013-08-15T04:59:22Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386676", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Office", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Office/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Office/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Office/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Office/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
