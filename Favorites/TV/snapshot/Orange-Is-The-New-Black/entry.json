You know in its glory days. The first few seasons before it went off the rails. That's what \"Orange Is the New Black\" is like. Equal parts funny and sad. A mix of true pathos and yet true honesty and beauty coming from the strangest places. Be warned however there is plenty of lesbian sex and if the \"F\" word makes your ears bleed it is probably a good idea to turn back now...This isn't OZ but this also isn't Disney. This is a true winner from Netflix and tells an interesting story not only from the main character's perspective but from the other inmates as well. It would have been boring to see things from just her point of view. Like Nancy Botwin on Weeds, sometime Piper Chapman is portrayed in not so good a light because she can be the villain in someone else's story.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Season 7 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4029332505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTliM2Y0OTYtZmYxZi00YjRkLThmMjUtM2YzNjBhODE3ZDAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTliM2Y0OTYtZmYxZi00YjRkLThmMjUtM2YzNjBhODE3ZDAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The epic conclusion of the series that changed everything. \"Orange Is the New Black\"'s final season arrives July 26.", "uploadDate": "2019-06-26T15:38:24Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2372162", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Orange-Is-The-New-Black", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Orange-Is-The-New-Black/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Orange-Is-The-New-Black/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Orange-Is-The-New-Black/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Orange-Is-The-New-Black/thumb.jpg"}
