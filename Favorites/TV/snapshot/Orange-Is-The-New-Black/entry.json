Like 'Weeds', 'Orange' is fresh and original, and like 'Weeds' the lead character is tragically flawed and hilariously funny.\n\nWell done to Netflix on their latest production... 'Hemlock Grove' is just weird, 'House of Cards' was hit and miss... but it looks like the third time is a charm. Bravo.\n\n(FYI: humour is how we Brits spell humor). :-)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Season 7 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4029332505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTliM2Y0OTYtZmYxZi00YjRkLThmMjUtM2YzNjBhODE3ZDAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTliM2Y0OTYtZmYxZi00YjRkLThmMjUtM2YzNjBhODE3ZDAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The epic conclusion of the series that changed everything. \"Orange Is the New Black\"'s final season arrives July 26.", "uploadDate": "2019-06-26T15:38:24Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2372162", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Orange-Is-The-New-Black", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Orange-Is-The-New-Black/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Orange-Is-The-New-Black/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Orange-Is-The-New-Black/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
