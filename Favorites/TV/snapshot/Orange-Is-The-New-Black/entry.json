It's way too focused on the relationship between Alex and Piper (a real snooze fest) and not focused enough on what makes these characters interesting. There is no spark here anymore. What made seasons 1 and 2 interesting just isn't there anymore. This story is played out. Time for it to go! And Pennsatucky! Really? Do new teeth completely transform a person? I think not. By far the most interesting character on the show, Red, has been reduced to a total stereotype - of the aging tough woman with a heart of gold. She was so interesting before and now she is just as boring as all of the other characters. Most boring of all is Alex. She was edgy in seasons 1 and 2 and now she is just annoying - not interesting at all. Did they change writers or producers or did they just have one good idea and they are stringing it out as long as possible? I will say that Crazy Eyes continues to be the most fun character to watch - played to perfection!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Season 7 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4029332505", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTliM2Y0OTYtZmYxZi00YjRkLThmMjUtM2YzNjBhODE3ZDAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTliM2Y0OTYtZmYxZi00YjRkLThmMjUtM2YzNjBhODE3ZDAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The epic conclusion of the series that changed everything. \"Orange Is the New Black\"'s final season arrives July 26.", "uploadDate": "2019-06-26T15:38:24Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2372162", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Orange-Is-The-New-Black", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Orange-Is-The-New-Black/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Orange-Is-The-New-Black/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Orange-Is-The-New-Black/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Orange-Is-The-New-Black/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
