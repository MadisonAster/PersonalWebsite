Brennan, \"savvy viewers will find Craig Ferguson hard to resist.\" That has been the case with my household. My husband and I rarely use to watch late night TV after the Jay/Dave time slot, but we can't get enough of Craig Ferguson. He can be variously described as charming, witty, off-the-cuff, extremely flexible (I love his character work in the show's hilarious sketches), self-effacing, silly, and down-right adorable! However Worldwide Pants went about choosing him, they knew what they were doing. It was pretty bold, putting an immigrant in such a high-profile position. I don't mean that in a derogatory way - it was a smart,gutsy move. Craig brings a new point-of-view to jokes about the news and other bits, alternating between telling things like any American would, since he has lived here for quite a while, and telling things from the perspective of an outsider,giving the viewers a sort of out-of-body experience. Yet he manages to never be un-American. He's towing the line rather well. And Craig is by far the sexiest, best-looking late night host there is now, period. I'm so glad that the comments written about Craig and The Late, Late Show in early January are still holding true now in late April. We can relax in the knowledge that he will be with us five nights a week for a long time to come.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3001859353", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ZhOTJmZGQtOGU4MS00YWY3LWJhNTgtY2RhYmM5Mjk3MTIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ZhOTJmZGQtOGU4MS00YWY3LWJhNTgtY2RhYmM5Mjk3MTIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson", "uploadDate": "2019-04-04T22:21:24Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437729", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Late-Show-with-Craig-Ferguson", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Late-Show-with-Craig-Ferguson/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Late-Show-with-Craig-Ferguson/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Late-Show-with-Craig-Ferguson/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Late-Show-with-Craig-Ferguson/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-10-08"}
