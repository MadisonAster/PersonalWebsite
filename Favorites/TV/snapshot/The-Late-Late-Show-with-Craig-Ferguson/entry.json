Now, I actually try NOT to miss it, because I love Craig Ferguson. I find him to be charming, interesting, witty, intelligent, down-to-earth, and....well, just darn HANDSOME. I didn't watch the Drew Carey Show more than a handful of times, and I hadn't heard of Craig until the Late Late Show started up again. The Scot in me finds him especially intriguing. In some ways he's like a younger version of my father, which, if you know him, is a huge compliment. Scotsmen rock! I just love how REAL Craig is - he's casually mentioned things of his past, positives and negatives, without making it into a \"woe is me\" or \"I'm the best\" type of thing. He also seems like a wonderful, fun father to his little boy. The Late Late Show is definitely something I'll be faithfully watching! Some talk shows I only watch depending on the GUESTS that will be on; this one I actually watch for the host! Craig Ferguson - keep up the great work."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3001859353", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ZhOTJmZGQtOGU4MS00YWY3LWJhNTgtY2RhYmM5Mjk3MTIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ZhOTJmZGQtOGU4MS00YWY3LWJhNTgtY2RhYmM5Mjk3MTIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson", "uploadDate": "2019-04-04T22:21:24Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437729", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Late-Show-with-Craig-Ferguson", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Late-Show-with-Craig-Ferguson/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Late-Show-with-Craig-Ferguson/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Late-Show-with-Craig-Ferguson/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-10-08"}
