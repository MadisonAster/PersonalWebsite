I often sit back and watch the 'On Demand' stuff because I want see what I like and what I don't, and more often than not I see what I don't.\n\n'Better Off Ted' was there. Never heard anything about it before. I put it on and was immediately swept away by the quick dialogue and the narration (I guess it's narration) to camera from my new best friend Ted. He works for a research and development company, beneath Veronica played by Portia De Rossi. The dialogue between these two is hysterical! This show reminds me of Arrested Development. Maybe it's the Portia De Rossi thing, maybe it's the dialogue. Either way, I'm already loving it, and I will be spreading the word of 'Better Off Ted'.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9", "worstRating": "1"}}, "url": "/title/tt1235547/", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-24"}
