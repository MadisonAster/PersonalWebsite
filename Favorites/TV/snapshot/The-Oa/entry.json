Not only is it a great story, but a very necessary one for this day and age. It's a clever, strange, mind-bending puzzle box with no shortage of theories to discuss, while also touching on the deeper aspects of humanity and our spiritual connection to one another. Every fan who loves it will tell you personal stories of how it has impacted their lives--healing from trauma, teaching us the value of patience, giving us faith and strength, challenging us to believe in the power of storytelling. I recommend this show to everyone I meet, because it's far more than just a show. It's an experience. Definitely worth a watch if you've never seen it, and I can pretty much guarantee that if you enjoy it, you'll want to watch it a hundred more times.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi274315801", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjVhYTMyYTktZGFhMi00M2ZmLTlhMTAtZWM2NzNiZDkwYmZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjVhYTMyYTktZGFhMi00M2ZmLTlhMTAtZWM2NzNiZDkwYmZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "OA successfully jumps dimensions but finds herself at the center of a mystery she cannot solve without the help of a cynical private detective.", "uploadDate": "2019-02-27T15:27:27Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4635282", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Oa", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Oa/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Oa/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Oa/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Oa/thumb.jpg"}
