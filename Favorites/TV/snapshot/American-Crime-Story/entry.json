Simpson is one that received wide scale media coverage and attention with the events being closely followed by many and is now the topic of season 1 of FX's new biographical crime drama, American Crime Story. However despite this, this show manages to remain just as gripping and haunting as the case was in real life.\n\nThe acting is across the board incredibly strong with not a weak performance among the main ensemble; Cuba Gooding Jr. and John Travolta in particular stand out. The writing is sharp, never is it overly formulaic or mundane but understandable and real, tension is built tremendously from the dialogue alone. But above all the direction is excellent, the tone is established straight from the beginning and it is crafted to such a high quality.\n\nThere is rarely a dull or wasted moment throughout, the story and pacing remains tight with no parts lacking in comparison to the soaring heights. The show, as said in the title of this review, is both evocative and powerful. The some of it's parts truly do this story justice and will more than likely stir something within you that compels you to keep watching and to examine this story in much more detail. As far as crime dramas go, this feels, to a certain extent, rather fresh and different in comparison to what has come before.\n\nThe show looks set to keep reaching new heights and it is off a magnificent start.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2: Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1521989657", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTdjY2MzZjQtOTQ2Yy00YTQ5LTg2MzQtZGNhOGUxZjA3MDM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM2NDM2MQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTdjY2MzZjQtOTQ2Yy00YTQ5LTg2MzQtZGNhOGUxZjA3MDM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDM2NDM2MQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the OFFICIAL TRAILER for The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.
