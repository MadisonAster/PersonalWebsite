Don't get me wrong, there was room for some improvements, but in general it was on point. Being a gay rapper myself, who did 5yrs out of a 7yr period in prison in Texas, as well as growing up in a hyper masculine Hispanic culture from San Antonio, I can speak from experience that this show was almost perfect. My partner, who's a white gentleman in his 50s, used to joke with me and say that Chozen was just basically me in a cartoon. Dat Boy Beast on SoundCloud if you want to see for yourself. \ud83d\ude1d\n\nAnywho, it's very unfortunate the show got cancelled.
