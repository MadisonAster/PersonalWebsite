I wish people gave it a chance. There are many reasons why the show flopped. I'll give my review and maybe it will answer a few things. First- I love gay subculture, specially the bear culture. So having an animated show about a gay bear was awesome! Then, I don't mind Rap- but not immersed too much into the lingo at all or even recent people. Hey I listened to Eminem and Insane Clown Posse- what do I know about Rap and Hip-hop? Nothing. So maybe I'm coming from the demographic this show is meant to be for- Gay people who sort of like rap. I have no clue. I loved this show the first time it aired. However I knew a few of the jokes they where trying way too hard. The animation was hot- damn they made Chozen sexy as hell. I can see that it was meant to be a satire on rap/ hip-hop culture by using a WHITE, GAY, maybe even Jewish/Italian guy doing rap. The show was trying too hard to be offensive in some parts- but it really did have a heart. Somewhere, it had a nice message but it never got time to really truly develop it's characters and when it just got good. Bam, cancelled. I personally give this show 8 out of 10 because of it's effort. Sometimes it hits the mark... other times it doesn't. But I loved it!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3221268", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Chozen", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Chozen/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Chozen/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Chozen/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-01-21"}
