The reason is because it blends real hard hitting, important, recent and at times controversial news stories with Jim's AMAZING witty and sarcastic humor. He also, makes the news understandable and able to be listened too by people that normally cannot stand listening to the regular news because it can be very boring. Jim isn't afraid of the hot button things to talk about either and I LOVE that!! He is new to this hosting thing and I am sure he will settle in AMAZINGLY after a few episodes. You could tell he was nervous on the pilot episode. He clearly cares about the USA ad all of us in it clearly. I couldn't give it a hard 10 yet because the topics he discusses in certain episodes just need more time and aren't able to be properly untangled within the time he is given. I would love to see an entire hour of this show instead of 30 minutes. I don't want to write this too long because people will lose interest and stop reading. So I will close with the fact that this is an AMAZING SHOW AND I LOVE IT VERY MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Jim Jefferies Show, The: Season 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1601879321", "name": "Jim Jefferies Show, The: Season 1", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ1OGMwZGEtNjRlNy00OTU5LTljYzktZTkwZjAzODA3NzA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ1OGMwZGEtNjRlNy00OTU5LTljYzktZTkwZjAzODA3NzA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2019-04-13T11:54:48Z"}, "url": "/title/tt6987966/"}
