These are not feature films, but one hour dramas, no different in concept or constraint from countless other network counterparts.  But, oh how different in result.\n\nOz is not for everyone.  It is violent, lurid, obscene, profane and controversial.  Oz us narrated dramatically by a \"Greek Chorus\" of inmates who make insightful observations not just about Oz, but applicable to the outside world as well.  The talent, none of it marquee, is nonetheless the finest assembly of supporting actors an ensemble cast could hope for.\n\nIn order to keep ratings up, the stories sometimes veer into the unbelievable, but the grit and reality are never gone for long.  Oz is also a bundle of irony.  Although it deals with homosexuality with insight and objectivity in every episode, it just as often bristles with gratuitous homoerotic overtone.  Despite the fact that it overflows with action and violence, it never mistakes kenesis for story.\n\nSometimes, Oz borders on, and crosses well into, genius.  Its often surreal direction elevates otherwise base events to sublime levels.  Music, pacing, convoluted story lines careening and intersecting in ways that are at the same time graceful and clumbsy, just like real life.\n\nThis is said to be the last season of Oz, and yet, only two seasons are on DVD.  With constant reruns and each episode being aired about a dozen times a week, you may be tired of this jewel anyway, but its influence will elevate the level of television drama for years to come."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Oz: The Complete First Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2476671257", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBjMTgxOTQtNTYyYy00YWM2LWIzMmMtZGRkNDBjNmYyMmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBjMTgxOTQtNTYyYy00YWM2LWIzMmMtZGRkNDBjNmYyMmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from HBO Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:35:58Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118421", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Oz", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Oz/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Oz/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Oz/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Oz/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-09-06"}
