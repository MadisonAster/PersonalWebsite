Quality wise, it's up there with the first 4 seasons of Homicide: Life on the Street as the most compelling hour of television drama. Presenting a harsh and realistic view of prison life, Oz is a wonderful mixture of superb acting and character development; all of which rides on a nuanced and erudite core (Foucault's Panopticon is the inspiration for Em City's design...and ultimate failure).  It is the only show on TV, that I can think of, that has presented characters who were intensely dislikable one moment and oddly empathetic the next.  That I am repulsed by, sympathetic with, intrigued about, and involved with every character that has lived, died or survived on the show, is no small feat.  Good TV exists. And, for my money, Oz is not only good TV, it is better than most films released throughout the year."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Home Video Trailer from HBO Home Video", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2476671257", "name": "Oz: The Complete First Season", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBjMTgxOTQtNTYyYy00YWM2LWIzMmMtZGRkNDBjNmYyMmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBjMTgxOTQtNTYyYy00YWM2LWIzMmMtZGRkNDBjNmYyMmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:35:58Z"}, "url": "/title/tt0118421/", "EntryAdded": "2013-09-06"}
