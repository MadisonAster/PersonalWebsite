It is a great show. But Oz is better. It might well be the best thing on television. It doesn't get the press of the Sopranos. And the other people who watch HBO (those who don't like all the violence) whould much rather watch Ferris Beuller's wife in SEX AND THE CITY, which I will NEVER watch. Oz is amazing because almost every charachter in it's sea of people is in some way a terrible human being. But the magic of this show is that these terrible people become understandable. They do terrible things, but they are not all bad. Ryan O'Rielly, for example, is a cold-blooded killer. But when it comes to his brother and doctor Nathan, and more recently the priest he befriended, he is a warm and caring person who's pain you empathize with. Oz takes murderers, rapists, thieves, and even a rich lawyer who ran down a young girl in a drunken stuper, and makes them likeable and forgivable. That's incredible.  And this show is incredible. It goes off the air soon for good, and I wish it had gotten the respect it deserved."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Oz: The Complete First Season", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2476671257", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBjMTgxOTQtNTYyYy00YWM2LWIzMmMtZGRkNDBjNmYyMmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBjMTgxOTQtNTYyYy00YWM2LWIzMmMtZGRkNDBjNmYyMmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from HBO Home Video", "uploadDate": "2008-04-11T15:35:58Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118421", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Oz", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Oz/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Oz/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Oz/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-09-06"}
