Armisen and Brownstein are a perfect duo who work well together and always manage to disappear fully into their characters. Whilst its not always laugh out loud funny (although I'm not sure that's exactly what they're aiming for anyway) I do always get a good giggle out of it. The show creates a wonderfully of-kilter world that is fun to dive in to for 20 minutes at a time, and immerse yourself in the little bubble that is Portlandia ! There's also some great cameos from stars such as Jeff Goldblum, Kristen Wiig and Bill Hader who always provide excellent comic relief, however Armisen and Brownstein do such a great job of pulling the show off on their own it's worth watching just to see them work together.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 5 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2774642457", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1MzU4MDIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODAwMzg0MzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1MzU4MDIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODAwMzg0MzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the trailer for the fifth season of \"Portlandia\".", "uploadDate": "2014-11-22T11:12:10Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1780441", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Portlandia", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Portlandia/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Portlandia/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Portlandia/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Portlandia/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-06-01"}
