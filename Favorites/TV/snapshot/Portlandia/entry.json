Every episode is funny, but, as with any TV shows (especially sketch comedy) there are some skits that are better than others. Most of the characters and sketches focus on the apparent headway that the west coast is making with hipster/green/vegan/feminist/alternative transportation lifestyles. (side note- the biker skit made me laugh very hard). This show will not be for everyone, but watch the first one or two episodes and you will know if you like it or not. No shame in thinking something isn't funny. As I said, I'm not a fan of every skit, though they're all tolerable, and it's worth muddling through for the sketches that make you laugh your ass off. The only big downside is that I can see it getting repetitive if it goes too long. Five seasons at most is my prediction. WATCH IT. They are only half hour episodes, and it's a good break from big network canned laughter BS. I posted before said bike skit link below if you want a good taste.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3nMnr8ZirI", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 5 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2774642457", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1MzU4MDIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODAwMzg0MzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY1MzU4MDIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODAwMzg0MzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the trailer for the fifth season of \"Portlandia\".", "uploadDate": "2014-11-22T11:12:10Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1780441", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Portlandia", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Portlandia/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Portlandia/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Portlandia/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-06-01"}
