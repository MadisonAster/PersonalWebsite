The Colbert Report was one of the funniest, if not THE funniest, shows on TV. It was clever, edgy and didn't mind taking pot shots at politicians, esp right-wing ones and Fox News. Surely moving to a mainsteam show would mean Colbert would have to dumb it down and appeal to a wider audience?\n\nWell, I gave it a fair chance but I fear I was right. The edginess has gone (\"Oh, no, kids might be watching!\") and his shtick has been dumbed down quite a lot. \n\nEven worse, and something I did not see coming as I figured its is well beneath him, he is having to play all those stupid clickbait games that Jimmy Fallon does (and which makes Fallon's show such a waste of time). You know, get some major star in and instead of asking them intelligent questions, get them to do something stupid. Just so that there'll be dozens of clickbait posts the next day with \"See Stephen Colbert get Victoria's Secret models to eat buffalo wings!\", say.\n\nThere are occasional glimpses of the old Colbert. Some clever skits, biting satire and the pokes at right-wing politicians, but they are few and far between. \n\nBest thing to do: watch the clever stuff, fast forward through the rest.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3697842", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Show-with-Stephen-Colbert", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Show-with-Stephen-Colbert/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Show-with-Stephen-Colbert/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Show-with-Stephen-Colbert/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Show-with-Stephen-Colbert/thumb.jpg"}
