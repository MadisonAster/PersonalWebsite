I went to a couple concerts in high school, like U2 and the Ramones, and had a shirt or two, but never wore them. I've always viewed that kind of celebrity worship as being kind of infantile. So when I do fall head over heels in love with a celebrity, it's kind of a big deal. And there's no celebrity, past or present, that I cherished as much as I cherished you.\n\nThere's a guy on a late night talk show that looks like you, sounds like you and even has your name, but this doppelganger doesn't have your soul. This grinning, unconfrontational Stepford Wife is a hollow shell of you. You were punk rock, this guy's Disneyland. You changed the world. He sells some hummus.\n\nIt's unbelievably difficult to imagine a life without you. I know that nothing lasts forever, so our time together was always going to come to an end, but it was a day I never wanted to see- and a day that came far too soon.\n\nI love you, I miss you.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3697842", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Show-with-Stephen-Colbert", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Show-with-Stephen-Colbert/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Show-with-Stephen-Colbert/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Show-with-Stephen-Colbert/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Late-Show-with-Stephen-Colbert/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-09-14"}
