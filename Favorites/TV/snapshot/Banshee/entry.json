I love the handmaids tale, pesky blinders etc... but they have nothing on this. Terrible, shocking series run for 12 seasons and you only give us 4 theres many ways you could tell a story and give us more. You stopped and told us theres an exciting new series to look forward to warrior? Have you seen you're reviews for that, granted its mixed but you're talking 8 thousand? Look at bansher we want more Netflix, hulu... bring this back please cinemax are clearly cutting their nose off to spite their face", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 4 Trailer #2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1681503513", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MDEzNjIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE5NTQxODE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk5MDEzNjIwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE5NTQxODE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Second season 4 trailer for Banshee on Cinemax.", "uploadDate": "2016-02-26T10:54:51Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2017109", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Banshee", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Banshee/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Banshee/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Banshee/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Banshee/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-03-11"}
