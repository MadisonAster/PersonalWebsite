The title character is Dr. Meredith Grey, whose mother, now in early dementia, was a renowned surgeon. The young Dr. Grey is played by Ellen Pompeo, a fairly experienced young actress who has a face that is more interesting than beautiful, but her acting is believable, making her a good choice for the role. All the others think she may be getting preferred treatment, but we see that she appears to be a gifted doctor.\n\nThe good ensemble cast includes quite a few, but I have three other favorites. Sandra Oh plays Dr. Yang, ambitious, always trying to get picked to assist in surgery, and in recent episodes has begun a clandestine affair with Dr Burke (Houstonian Isaiah Washington), one of members of the surgical team. The other is Chandra Burke, another Houstonian, as the 'nazi' Dr. Miranda Bailey. She is in charge of the new residents, and makes them understand early that when she is sleeping, they should only disturb her if someone is on the verge of death. She really is a good and kind character, but she has to play it tough to establish boundaries.\n\nSo far I have only seen two or three episodes, but they have been interesting, well-written, and well-acted. Not the usual \"doctor\" soap series."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 12 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi17412889", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC.", "uploadDate": "2015-09-23T10:21:18Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Greys-Anatomy", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Greys-Anatomy/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Greys-Anatomy/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Greys-Anatomy/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Greys-Anatomy/thumb.jpg"}
