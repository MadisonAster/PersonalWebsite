I didn't know if I would like it or not, because I'm not a big ER fan, due to the depressing parts, however \"Grey's Anatomy\" has a lot more depth to it on so many levels. Let's face it, who really wants to talk about death? This show involves some humor, unlike ER, but you also get the blood and guts popping out, very sad moments, more involved stories about the DR's personal life's, issues that are bombarding our medical care in this country today and the great music puts it over the top. It's more of a \"tug at your heart strings\" kind of show when it comes to death and also there are some politics involved, which i highly think should be brought up in this day and age-such as being a full donor and saving peoples lives, rather than rotting away. I'm actually surprised it's not a David Kelly Show (Boston Legal) - it seems like something he'd create. Anyway, you have to watch this show- it's completely addicting-- and I only watched it since i like Patrick Dempsey on the off chance it may be a good show--Wow, was I pleasantly surprised. I did also like Boston Legal, but not nearly like \"Greys.\" Hopefully there is room for both of them on Sunday nights."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 12 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi17412889", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC.", "uploadDate": "2015-09-23T10:21:18Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413573", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Greys-Anatomy", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Greys-Anatomy/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Greys-Anatomy/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Greys-Anatomy/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Greys-Anatomy/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
