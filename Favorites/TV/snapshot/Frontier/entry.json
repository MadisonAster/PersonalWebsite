There may be some inaccuracies but don't forget it's not a documentary. The story line is quite interesting- made me watch all episodes in 2 nights. Kudos to the actors as well! It reminds me a bit of Assassin's creed III which is also awesome. So yeah...I hope they won't leave it with just 1 season....but knowing the popularity of those kinds of shows, out of the mainstream- I won't be surprised if Frontier follows the fate of other great canceled historical dramas as The Borgias, Copper, Da Vinci's Demons, etc. Best of luck!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 3 Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2531375641", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWJjZTVmMWItODEwYy00NWJmLTg0OTEtNzBlNTI1MjA1YWIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWJjZTVmMWItODEwYy00NWJmLTg0OTEtNzBlNTI1MjA1YWIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "While Harp pursues Lord Benton to rescue Grace, Michael takes command of the Black Wolf Company and Sokanon embarks on a righteous crusade.", "uploadDate": "2018-11-16T00:22:40Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4686698", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Frontier", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Frontier/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Frontier/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Frontier/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
