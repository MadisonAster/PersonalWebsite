Erlich Bachman (T.J. Miller) is the arrogant homeowner who sees himself as incubator for new programmers with 10% interest. Richard and Big Head's day job is working for Hooli under self-important CEO Gavin Belson (Matt Ross). Monica Hall (Amanda Crew) works for VC Peter Gregory and later awkwardly cold Laurie Bream (Suzanne Cryer). Donald 'Jared' Dunn (Zach Woods) realizes the potential of Piped Pipper and shows it to Gavin Belson.\n\nThis is a fun show about the new Titans and the new Greek tragedies. These are flawed yet loveable characters. Middleditch portrays Richard's self doubt and insistent vision perfectly. Gilfoyle and Dinesh are a perfect comedy duo. It's a new world and we're only living in it. Other than a minor road bump that is T.J. Miller's personal problem, Mike Judge has created the next Office Space.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 6 Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2598485785", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdiMmFhYjUtMDJiZS00MzczLTkyYzEtZjJkNzY4YTdkNTU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdiMmFhYjUtMDJiZS00MzczLTkyYzEtZjJkNzY4YTdkNTU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg", "description": "Big tech, bigger data, biggest season.
