It's going to be a good show. You know a show will be good when there are a number of good characters introduced in the first 1/2 hour. Very rarely do I laugh out loud but it happened a few times in the first episode. \n\nI don't know a lot about tech, but you'll understand the humor in this. Guess it helps that I've been and have friends working in Silicon Valley... As long as you have an IT department in your business you'll be able to relate as well...\n\nLooking forward to next week.
