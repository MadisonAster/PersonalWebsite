I hope this will be a great series overall. \n\nBtw I also like other Mike Judge's works: the Beavis & Butthead cartoon series and the Idiocracy movie.\n\nI've never been to California and never worked for Google or Apple but I know this western IT culture pretty well, and the series makes good laugh of it. The main character should have taken 10 million :) Now the whole series will be about how he gets trampled over and over by the vultures of capitalism. Should be fun to watch.\n\nOn a side note, it's great to see movies finally catching up with the new realities of life. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram - these words now play a vital role in lives of the vast share of the world's population, but movie directors have been far from these areas until now. Good work Mike, keep it coming! :)", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 6 Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2598485785", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdiMmFhYjUtMDJiZS00MzczLTkyYzEtZjJkNzY4YTdkNTU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdiMmFhYjUtMDJiZS00MzczLTkyYzEtZjJkNzY4YTdkNTU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg", "description": "Big tech, bigger data, biggest season.
