I have to say, the cast is freaking FANTASTIC. All of them are great actors who really fits into the role that they are suppose to play. When I first saw the main character Pete I said to myself, \"Wow he really reminds me of Jesse Pinkman.\" And next thing I know, I see Bryan Cranston on screen and I got really excited. Hopefully, more episodes will come soon, but since it is an Amazon Pilot, who knows how many months it will be until we see a new episode. I hope it doesn't get the same treatment as Man In the High Castle because that show was amazing, but we haven't seen a new episode in 7 months.\n\nThe first episode of Sneaky Pete moved along at a great pace. Each character is being developed at a steady pace and they all feel like an integral part of the show already (maybe except the Grandpa). In a way this show kind of reminds me of White Collar, except it doesn't have that \"light\" vibe. I don't know how else to describe it, but there is a more serious tone to Sneaky Pete and that's what I really like about it. A con-man using the head hunting business to catch other criminals is very intriguing because it lets you see various types of criminal minds. There were a couple of suspenseful moments where you think someone suspects him or a character might be in actual danger, but never enough for it to be a nail biter. What's going to put this show above others is going to be the diversity of the criminals and the ability to show the viewers how a con-man really thinks. Overall a very interesting show with great potential and I can't wait to watch more!!!\n\nIf this review was informative in any way, please give me a helpful vote! It helps me out a lot and I would really appreciate it.
