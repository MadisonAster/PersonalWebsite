Ribisi gets an Emmy. The show gets an Emmy--if they will produce more episodes in short order. Other than Major Crimes, we've had no new shows hold our interest (Battle Creek was canceled on us, as was Maxwell & King) so resorted to watching movies we've missed. Now Sneaky Pete. It got our attention in the first 5 minutes and held it. So often, we have to say, \"Well, we'll watch the second episode and see if it goes anywhere.\" Better Call Saul worked like that, now we're waiting for the next season, but mostly it's been a drought for us. \n\nI've been so-so on Ribisi over the years. Really didn't like him in Boiler Room. But he has so matured as an actor that he carries this show. Perfection! (If he has an acting coach, we need that name.)\n\nI like seeing the high rating here, and the one review being good and accurate. Now if Amazon will just deliver on the promise of the pilot, Sneaky Pete will absolutely be a hit.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "timeRequired": "PT54M", "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2933961497", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk5MTkxOTcxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM2Nzc0NjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk5MTkxOTcxNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM2Nzc0NjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official trailer for Sneaky Pete available on Amazon Instant Video.", "uploadDate": "2015-08-07T05:25:56Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4200136", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Sneaky-Pete", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Sneaky-Pete/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Sneaky-Pete/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Sneaky-Pete/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-08-08"}
