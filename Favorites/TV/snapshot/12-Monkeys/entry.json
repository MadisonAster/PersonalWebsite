The only thing that it borrows from the movie so far is the general plot of people traveling back in time to stop a whole ending plague, and that's only the beginning, it has since becoming some thing so much more.\n\nEverything else is new, from the storyline to most of the characters and the direction of the plot. This is especially true for season 3 which really going deep into exploring the different facet of time travel.\n\nThere are many shows before this that pertains to time travel like quantum leap, continuum and legends of tomorrow. But what most of these shows do is just use time travel as an after thought or an excuse to put the characters in a situation and completely forget and ignore the premise, they are closer to adventure series than sci-fi.\n\nWhat THIS show does is exploring the the \"what-ifs\" and \"why nots\" of time travel. It's a true sci-fi show. Give it a chance, if you like science fiction at all, there's a high chance you'll love the show as much as I do.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 4 Comic-Con Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3788486937", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTdmZTRmOGEtZjgxYS00NGJjLWIyZDUtMTg2ZGUwNzc3M2QwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTdmZTRmOGEtZjgxYS00NGJjLWIyZDUtMTg2ZGUwNzc3M2QwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch the Season 4 Comic-Con Trailer for \"12 Monkeys.\"", "uploadDate": "2017-07-21T23:58:53Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3148266", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/12-Monkeys", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/12-Monkeys/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/12-Monkeys/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/12-Monkeys/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-01-17"}
