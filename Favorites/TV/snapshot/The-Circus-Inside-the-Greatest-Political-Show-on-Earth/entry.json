As an Independent, this evolution was very disappointing.\n\nThe move away from balance led the series to make a number of veiled predictions and analyses that, in retrospect, turned out to be comically wrong. Even worse, the series attempted to ridicule and marginalize anyone with a view different than their conventional wisdom which, again, turned out to be mostly wrong.\n\nOverall, a good microcosm of what happens when people/organizations become hyper-partisan. Too bad because this series had a lot of promise.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "The Circus: Inside The Greatest Political Show On Earth: Season 3", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi938655001", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDUzOTUwOTgtMjlmMS00MGFkLThiY2EtZWY0MTJkYTMyNWQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDUzOTUwOTgtMjlmMS00MGFkLThiY2EtZWY0MTJkYTMyNWQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The Circus: Inside The Greatest Political Show On Earth: Season 3", "uploadDate": "2019-03-18T18:41:42Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5351176", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Circus-Inside-the-Greatest-Political-Show-on-Earth", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Circus-Inside-the-Greatest-Political-Show-on-Earth/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Circus-Inside-the-Greatest-Political-Show-on-Earth/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Circus-Inside-the-Greatest-Political-Show-on-Earth/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Circus-Inside-the-Greatest-Political-Show-on-Earth/thumb.jpg"}
