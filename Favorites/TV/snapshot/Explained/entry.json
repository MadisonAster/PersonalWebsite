A documentary is made to educate, using scientific data and ethical, unbiased reporting. Some of these episodes however, rely on socially motivated testimony, anecdotal evidence, and pop-culture pseudoscience to convince the audience of one point of view or perspective. These episodes are much closer to a coercive essay or even propoganda, leading the audience to believe the opinion of the new-age narrative to be fact, rather than reporting on all perspectives and data leaving the conclusions to the audience.  Be weary if you leave the show feeling convinced of something; documentaries should educate and inform an audience, using ethical reporting and unbiased opinions without presenting a conclusion so that the audience can reach conclusions or opinions of their own. A documentary or report should not, however, aim to convince an audience using coercive language, unethical reporting, and motivated testimony to support the conclusion drawn or thesis or presented to be true.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Explained: Season 2", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4036542233", "name": "Explained: Season 2", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTgxMTk3MzEtNjdiNi00MWZhLTgyZWEtYjU1YWQ0MzlmY2JiXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTgxMTk3MzEtNjdiNi00MWZhLTgyZWEtYjU1YWQ0MzlmY2JiXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2019-09-21T13:02:25Z"}, "url": "/title/tt8005374/"}
