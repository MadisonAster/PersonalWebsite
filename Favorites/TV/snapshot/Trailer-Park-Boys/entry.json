However, since then I've forced myself to watched the entire Seasons 1-3 and I have to say it: man, was I wrong.\n\nIt grows on you. If you can get over the bad acting and the political incorrectness you'll find one hell of a show. As another reviewer said it's not an accurate reflection of life in a Nova Scotia trailer park: more like if you took the weirdest members of every trailer park in NS and put them together to dumb it up.\n\nSome of the funnier aspects I've found have been Ricky's constant mispronunciations (there are at least then in every episode), Mr Lahey's constant sh*t analogies, and, of course, Bubbles, who makes even the bad episodes worth watching.\n\nIf you give it a chance you won't have a single favourite episode; more like a collection of favorite moments pulled from each ep. Whether it's J-Roc's identity crisis (\"I hate to admit it ... I'm white\"), Bubbles' dragging a drunken Ricky home in the back of his go-cart, or the visit from the hysterically creepy Bible Pimp, there'll be at least something that makes you giggle whenever you think of it.\n\nAll that said, BBC America can look forward to a few letters of mixed reactions, and Comedy Central can start kicking themselves for not being the first to snatch it up."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 10 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1080472857", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1NzQwNTE1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY2NjY0ODE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1NzQwNTE1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY2NjY0ODE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Season 10 trailer for Trailer Park Boys on Netflix.", "uploadDate": "2016-03-29T08:18:15Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290988", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
