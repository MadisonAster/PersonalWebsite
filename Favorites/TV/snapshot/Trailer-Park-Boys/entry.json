There are operas, soap operas, space operas, and now \"park operas\". \n\nConsider how difficult it must be to act improv style not only on the set, but to act \"in character\" during all media interviews and public engagements, as is the expectation. Not many actors would have the commitment or stamina to carry this through for the benefit of the production image. Mike Smith, who plays the character Bubbles, apparently can only wear the thick glasses for 15 minutes at a time without extreme fatigue.\n\nLet's consider the acting quality and skill. Would Deniro or Pacino make this a better series? No! The charm is in the rough edges, the improv, the humility, and the belief that these are low rung thugs. It is totally believable and a credit to the acting and direction.\n\nHow is Canada or Nova Scotia being insulted if we recognize that this series is a parody and that we should not take it so seriously. According to the on-line polls I have viewed for TPB of the episodes to date, the average rating has been 9 out of 10. Most of those voting were from Canada followed by participants from the US, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. We should be proud that we have had an impact on others, especially on those outside of our country. \n\nIf given a chance, you will see how the brilliance shines through the layers of carefully placed sh#@. It is meant to look amateurish!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 10 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1080472857", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1NzQwNTE1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY2NjY0ODE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1NzQwNTE1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY2NjY0ODE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Season 10 trailer for Trailer Park Boys on Netflix.", "uploadDate": "2016-03-29T08:18:15Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290988", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
