The first time I saw it I was insulted, but after seeing it because i couldn't pick up anything else on the tv, I really enjoyed it.\n\nI would like to see more spin offs from a show like this. This is Melrose Place or 90210 on Welfare and it freakingly hilarious.\n\nThe cast is very classic characters. The dialogue is cheesey and trite, but it all fits in perfectly.\n\nThe entire production is cheap, but made to be purposely done that way...and it comes off great. There are few comedies that are not Hollywood formula and this is one.\n\nI can only state that for Canadian programming, this is far better than any \"road To Avonlea\" type programming.\n\nLately Canadian television series have become very edgy and have defined characters with unique definition...and it's about time.\n\nIt's time that comedy has gotten away from the \"FRIENDS\" and \"FRASIER\" type lame ass comedy writing and became creative like this show.\n\nI look for more series episodes and possibly a feature movie too.\n\nI've had the opportunity to live in a trailer park for several months in Florida, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico and British Columbia...I can easily relate to some of the characters that I have met in this series to real life people.\n\nFantastic view of a very unique position of life.\n\nAwesome job."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 10 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1080472857", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1NzQwNTE1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY2NjY0ODE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1NzQwNTE1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY2NjY0ODE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Season 10 trailer for Trailer Park Boys on Netflix.", "uploadDate": "2016-03-29T08:18:15Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290988", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys/thumb.jpg"}
