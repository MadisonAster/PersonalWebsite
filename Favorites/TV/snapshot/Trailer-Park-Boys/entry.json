I don't know how you could possible hate it - it's full of site gags and great one-liners! I reiterate - I don't understand how someone could hate it.\n\nIn the show Jim Lahey has some of the best lines ever! \"We're about to head into a sh** typhon Randy, you better haul in the sails before they get covered in sh**\" -- Jim Lahey\n\nThe only thing that is unfortunate about this show is that they only produce 8 eps per season (except for Season 5 which has 10 episodes).\n\nThis show is better than sliced bread and I can watch the episodes over and over again!\n\nPeople complain about Canadian shows sucking -- TPB was picked up in the US!! It must be worthwhile! \n\nKeep up the great work TPB!\n\nZack"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 10 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1080472857", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1NzQwNTE1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY2NjY0ODE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1NzQwNTE1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY2NjY0ODE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Season 10 trailer for Trailer Park Boys on Netflix.", "uploadDate": "2016-03-29T08:18:15Z"}, "Title": "Trailer Park Boys", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290988", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Trailer-Park-Boys/entry.json"}
