Here he is playing a serious character without his British accent! I had to check the name in the credits to make sure it was him.\n\nI hope the American public recognizes what a great actor he is.\n\nIf you like him in House, MD, watch him in the Black Adder series."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "House: Season Eight", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi51488537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDMyODQ1YTItMjdiZi00M2UyLWFjZGQtNTk3YWI4NTQ5ZWI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDMyODQ1YTItMjdiZi00M2UyLWFjZGQtNTk3YWI4NTQ5ZWI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for House: Season Eight", "uploadDate": "2013-01-27T06:18:51Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/House-MD", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/House-MD/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/House-MD/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/House-MD/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/House-MD/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-08-19"}
