It is tightly-written, and there are at least as many layers to the characters as there are to the medical mysteries. The worst part about the show is having to wait a whole week for the next episode to air.\n\nThe bickering and bantering among the doctors involved add an appreciable depth of humour and humanity as they work together to solve each case. The process they go through with each case shows the human fallibility of doctors as well as the fear and frustration of those waiting for the doctors to save their loved ones, and the show pokes fun at, justifies, argues against, dismisses and ultimately humanizes the arrogance for which doctors are infamous.\n\nThe cast is absolutely fantastic - I just love how these people work together. They are absolutely real and human as their characters alternately combat and cooperate with each other. They are the reason the plots hang so well together. And Laurie is just supreme. The sarcasm, the barbs, the snide remarks, and even the insults are so ridiculously honest one has to laugh.\n\nKudos to the casting people and the writers as well as the creator - this is one of the best shows ever. I hope it lives for many many seasons, and I can hardly wait to see where it leads!"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "House: Season Eight", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi51488537", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDMyODQ1YTItMjdiZi00M2UyLWFjZGQtNTk3YWI4NTQ5ZWI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDMyODQ1YTItMjdiZi00M2UyLWFjZGQtNTk3YWI4NTQ5ZWI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for House: Season Eight", "uploadDate": "2013-01-27T06:18:51Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0412142", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/House-MD", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/House-MD/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/House-MD/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/House-MD/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-08-19"}
