All of the actors deliver superlative performances. Bateman, Linney and Garner are a sight to behold, especially Bateman who steps out of his normal character. Peter Mullan and Lisa Emery portray two of the most convincing and vicious villains with such subtleness. It's almost hard not to admire their characters. The writing, cinematography, directing, setting and acting are marvelous. The plot revolves around a financial planner who ends up in a money laundering scheme. Eventually he ends up having to relocate his family to the Ozarks in order to continue laundering money for a ruthless Mexican drug cartel against his will. The main consequences behind this are trying to save his family and everyone around him. The plot is clever, surreal, intense, violent, unparalleled, gritty, unique, duplicitous and cathartic. The series is pure art and masterful in all aspects. It is outstanding in examining just how far your average Joe will go when lives are at stake. I am a \" Breaking Bad\" and \" Better Call Saul\" fan since the first episodes of both series. \"Ozark\" stands right up there with each and is as good if not better. I can only hope that more seasons will follow.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 3 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3030564377", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODEzZGZmNWQtNTI4Ny00MGNiLWFlMGYtNzdlM2EyZGNhYTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODEzZGZmNWQtNTI4Ny00MGNiLWFlMGYtNzdlM2EyZGNhYTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer for Ozark Season 3.
