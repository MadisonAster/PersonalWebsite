Be warned: Ozark is not family friendly as it has a multitude of graphic violence, nudity, mature language and sexual themes. Not for children. I am not a big fan of contemporary dramas, but it was Jason Bateman's outstanding performance in The Gift that led me to check out Ozark. And his character Marty Byrde delivers the same smug arrogance as a finance adviser turned greedy money launderer whose circumstances hurdles the patriarch into survival mode, which is tested repeatedly. Laura Linney is brilliant as his unfaithful/neglected wife Wendy Byrde who proves she is as much as an urbane grifter as her husband. Everyone in the cast delivered superb performances. The drama-charged first episode managed to pull me into the entire series and although some of the plot seems downright incredible (disbelief) I was captivated until the end. Look forward to a second season.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 3 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3030564377", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODEzZGZmNWQtNTI4Ny00MGNiLWFlMGYtNzdlM2EyZGNhYTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODEzZGZmNWQtNTI4Ny00MGNiLWFlMGYtNzdlM2EyZGNhYTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official Trailer for Ozark Season 3.
