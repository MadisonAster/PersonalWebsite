They stuck with their plan and created the greatest show we may ever see.\n\nThank you for existing.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "\"Say My Name\"", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi338798873", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTJiMzgwZTktYzZhZC00YzhhLWEzZDUtMGM2NTE4MzQ4NGFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpybA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTJiMzgwZTktYzZhZC00YzhhLWEzZDUtMGM2NTE4MzQ4NGFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpybA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Here's a look at the final eight episodes of Breaking Bad, which premieres on Sunday, August 11 at 9/8c", "uploadDate": "2013-08-06T09:15:19Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Breaking-Bad", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Breaking-Bad/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Breaking-Bad/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Breaking-Bad/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Breaking-Bad/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-08-19"}
