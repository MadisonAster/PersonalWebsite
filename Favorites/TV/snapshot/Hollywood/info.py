                          'here is my review for it. The premise of the show '
                          'sees a group of actors and filmakers try to get '
                          'there big break in Hollywood after World War 2 and '
                          'what exactly that requires. Main Character There '

                          'well, he mixes the cheesiness and the dramatic '
                          'aspects of the character, he should come across as '
                          "generic but I didn't find this because of his "
                          'strong performance. He manages to get sympathy but '
                          'also feel flawed making him an interesting '

                          'will talk about a few of them, first Dylan '

                          'and charismatic on this show. He tries to help Jack '

                          'and he is brilliant, for those that just think of '
                          'him in The Big Bang Theory then watch this show, he '
                          'plays a slimy and powerful agent and you see this '
                          'interesting character and how his mind works '
                          'throughout the show. There are a bunch of younger '

                          'of Hollywood. It also does a great job of showing '

                          'really inspire people and change society. But this '

                          'really forced. You would not believe how many '

                          'I get the message they were going for and it does '
                          'work, it just feels a bit forced and over done. '
                          'Also there are just too many characters that the '

                          'things more depth. Script The script for this show '

                          'that is here then it works, I accept it because '
