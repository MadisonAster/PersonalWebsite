Now that two episodes have been released however, any concerns should be put aside by anyone interested, because this is fantastic.\n\nGilligan's camera work is masterful and similarly creative to that of Breaking Bad, and Saul as a character or should I say 'Jimmy McGill', is not as vacuous as I once thought, and whilst it was obvious Saul Goodman was a facade, to see his other side in the flesh is great. The acting is fantastic, with very powerful scenes already in the first two episodes, and the tone is dark, but often quite humorous with plenty of laughs throughout.\n\nBasically to sum up in two words: watch this.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10", "worstRating": "1"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Welcome to Saul Goodman's world. \"Better Call Saul\" Season 5 premieres Sunday, February 23, 2020.", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4166106905", "name": "Season 5 Trailer", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWEyOTRmN2QtNDlmZS00YThiLWEzNGEtNzIxYTc4OTBjNDY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWEyOTRmN2QtNDlmZS00YThiLWEzNGEtNzIxYTc4OTBjNDY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-01-30T04:14:46Z"}, "url": "/title/tt3032476/", "EntryAdded": "2015-02-11"}
