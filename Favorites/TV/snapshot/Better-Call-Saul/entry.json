We are beginning the season with many strings left untied but I have complete faith in all questions being answered. If you loved Breaking bad for all the reasons I did including the cinematography, music, scenery, characters and most of all the story line, then you will love this. I apologize for going slightly off topic but in looking back at the breaking bad episode with the fly in the lab, some people found that they did not enjoy this episode, I on the other hand loved it. I appreciate the pure genius of the directing that goes behind every minute of the show. I understand and respect that people are entitled to their own opinion but after reading the negative reviews given here about \"Better Call Saul\" all I can say is that they don't get it, and that is OK. It is worth a watch because if you end up enjoying the show you wont just like it, you will love it. This is the next life changing show that will become something you look forward to for many years. I am truly excited for what's to come.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 5 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4166106905", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWEyOTRmN2QtNDlmZS00YThiLWEzNGEtNzIxYTc4OTBjNDY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWEyOTRmN2QtNDlmZS00YThiLWEzNGEtNzIxYTc4OTBjNDY0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Welcome to Saul Goodman's world. \"Better Call Saul\" Season 5 premieres Sunday, February 23, 2020.", "uploadDate": "2020-01-30T04:14:46Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3032476", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Better-Call-Saul", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Better-Call-Saul/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Better-Call-Saul/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Better-Call-Saul/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-02-11"}
