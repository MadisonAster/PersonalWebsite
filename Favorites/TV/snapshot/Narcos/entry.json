It's weird to sympathise with a drug lord but this show makes the audience feel his ambitions in politics, his love for family, caring for poor people and even for animals. In fact Netflix did so well I couldn't even continue season 2 because I know watching any kinds of downfall of people or empires will give me a had time, especially since Pablo is not a pure evil character that you can simply pour hate on.\n\nOverall a must-watch, very fast-paced and gripping, the acting (except agent Murphy who seems to only have one facial expression) and music are phenomenal. I would even say educational because I went on to explore more about the history behind, and also fell in love with this country.\n\nThere are two things that bothered me a lot: 1. Agent Murphy's annoying voice over! Forever explaining the simplest things, or giving the hint of plot twists ruining all the surprises the show will represent us. I would even give spoiler alert to the voice over. Can you just let the audience enjoy the show as it develops! 2. The show favours the US and DEA too much by portraying them as the heroes. Or maybe it's just agent Murphy that I had problem with.\n\nBut who am I to say so just watch it and you won't regret!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 3 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3929979161", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzI4ZDgyOTEtZTM2Yi00MDkyLWEwMDItMzlmNTNjOWJmMDA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzI4ZDgyOTEtZTM2Yi00MDkyLWEwMDItMzlmNTNjOWJmMDA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Now that the bloody hunt for Pablo Escobar has ended, the DEA turns its attention to the richest drug trafficking organization in the world: the Cali Cartel.
