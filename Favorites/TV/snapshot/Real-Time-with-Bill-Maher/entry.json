Maher is always one of the four. Then there will be two liberal guests (for example, Michael Moore or the guy who writes the \"comic\" strip The Boondocks). Then there will be a conservative guest, like Larry Miller or Ann Coulter. And the 3 liberals gang up and try to destroy the conservative viewpoint. They do this by interrupting and making false accusations.\n\nMaher tries to play Devil's Advocate and be equal between the two sides, but after about 6 minutes he drops this charade and joins the liberals, gaining much applause from the liberal audience who came out to watch the show for free.\n\nVery biased. Only decent part is the monologue, and half of the jokes miss.\n\n2/10."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 16 Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2030353177", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWU0MzhiODItY2RiOS00OGMyLTk2ODYtNzUxNmZhYTE3N2MwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWU0MzhiODItY2RiOS00OGMyLTk2ODYtNzUxNmZhYTE3N2MwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2018-08-27T23:24:21Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0350448", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Real-Time-with-Bill-Maher", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Real-Time-with-Bill-Maher/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Real-Time-with-Bill-Maher/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Real-Time-with-Bill-Maher/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Real-Time-with-Bill-Maher/thumb.jpg"}
