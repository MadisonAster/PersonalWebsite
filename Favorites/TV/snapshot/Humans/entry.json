Keeping my fingers crossed it will maintain this standard. Although I know this was adapted from a Swedish series I'm deliberately staying away from it for now. The opening episode certainly seems to have captured the sense of atmosphere and something impending that Scandinavians do so well. With a cast which is more than able to add some heft to the 'human' side of the story - it was equally gratifying to see the 'synthetics' pull off the difficult balancing act between machine behavior and enough 'emotional' content to set the series up for some dramatic juxtapositions. Although there is a small level of \"adult\" content I think its use, given the use of technology in our own world, was both relevant and all too believable.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2429007385", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMzY2ODkxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI5MzE4MDI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMzY2ODkxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI5MzE4MDI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In a parallel present where the latest must-have gadget for any busy family is a 'Synth' - a highly-developed robotic servant that's so similar to a real human it's transforming the way we live.", "uploadDate": "2016-12-09T12:39:26Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4122068", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Humans", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Humans/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Humans/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Humans/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Humans/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-07-27"}
