With all the great TV out there it can be hard to choose what to watch and not every show has a great start but develops into something memorable. As a result we always wait until we have DVR'd at least three episodes before watching the first. The other reason we record three is if the show is good we will want more immediately. Humans however left us wanting more after the third episode.\n\nThe concepts in this show are not ground breaking for any fan of the genre or any reader of science fiction but the fact it is set in the present day in a very relatable parallel reality (especially for Brits) is where this series gets its mojo. This is a thinking persons show the story is secondary to the compelling analysis of human nature and it's reactions to technology. Those who embrace it, those who reject it both are catered for here.\n\nThe production values are so very high and the casting is exemplary. Most people are not well known with the exception of William Hurt but there are familiar faces (again, especially for Brits) in there.\n\nThis show is not all action but is guaranteed to thrill you and chill you with it's moody pacing, moments of comedy and disturbing critique of humanity facing the very nature of its own creation.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2429007385", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMzY2ODkxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI5MzE4MDI@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMzY2ODkxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI5MzE4MDI@._V1_.jpg", "description": "In a parallel present where the latest must-have gadget for any busy family is a 'Synth' - a highly-developed robotic servant that's so similar to a real human it's transforming the way we live.", "uploadDate": "2016-12-09T12:39:26Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4122068", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Humans", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Humans/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Humans/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Humans/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-07-27"}
