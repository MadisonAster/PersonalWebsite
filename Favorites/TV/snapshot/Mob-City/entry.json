This is true to the time and accurate on most levels. Based on true events really make you think who's on your side. The law is corrupted , the the bad guys (mob) are bad news and love the fact that LA was so liberal in regards to interracial blending in public bars and clubs. Love the Jazz movement and soulful singers. The locations used in the pilot are LA today but all the old buildings that were built in the 20's and 30's seem new. You get a real appreciation for the history of LA the architecture and the rise of Hollywood and show business too. This is our history...this is truly how people lived in those days. There seems to be a lot of blood shed and dismemberment pretty hardcore for the faint of heart but may appeal to a male dominate audience. Would like to see more ladies in coming episodes with a hint of glamor and old Hollywood!, may attract a larger female demographic. Directed by one of the best!, bravo to all parties involved. Looking forwards to episode 2.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Sneak Peek", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1059367193", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwODU5NzA4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY0ODkxMzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwODU5NzA4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY0ODkxMzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch a trailer for Frank Darabont's upcoming TNT series \"Mob City\".", "uploadDate": "2013-08-14T10:16:05Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2176609", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Mob-City", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Mob-City/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Mob-City/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Mob-City/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-12-15"}
