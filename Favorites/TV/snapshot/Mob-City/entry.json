Or more than one that is. Especially when you look at how it's been done and that it only had six episodes all together.

I guess that not enough did watch it, though I can't say why that is. There surely are enough fans of this out there, to merit more of it. Still and with the talent at hand moving on to other projects, it still makes sense to \"just\" watch this one season, because it's really good.
