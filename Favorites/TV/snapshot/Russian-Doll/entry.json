What a ride. This series compelled me to reactivate my account to write a review.\n\nFirst of all - please do not expect laugh out loud comedy. This is a very dark and sometimes very unpleasant series. Yet, it is sometimes hilarious in its own way.\n\nThe story of Russian Doll is based on a now often used device, granted. But it is by no means formulaic. In fact, there are so many twists and turns in the development section of the 8 episodes, you will be glued to the screen.\n\nSome people didn't like the main character, calling her nasty and unpleasant. But this is the point of the series! She is a deeply troubled person. But trust me, she will become likeable soon enough - and stay tuned for the arrival of another main character (played by Charlie Barnett), who totally makes up for everything cringeworthy the potty-mouthed character played by Natasha Lyonne did until this point.\n\nIn the end, I promise you, you will have watched a cathartic experience that will leave you very happy.\n\nOn the technical level, Russian Doll is unusually well shot. The lighting reminds me of classic Mario Bava movies (I think this is intentional), and the music is very well sought.\n\nSo, go watch this, and please watch beyond episode 3, you will thank me later.\n\nIf only all takes on old plot devices were this awesome! Netflix, you need to give us more like this, not that narcissistic crap that so often pops up lately (Girl Boss, Insatiable with TRULY unlikeable characters)."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Russian Doll: Season 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi459521305", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVhMDM3YzYtYWFlZi00Mzc5LWIzNWEtOThlZTg3YjJmNGRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVhMDM3YzYtYWFlZi00Mzc5LWIzNWEtOThlZTg3YjJmNGRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Russian Doll: Season 1", "uploadDate": "2019-04-14T00:15:32Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7520794", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Russian-Doll", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Russian-Doll/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Russian-Doll/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Russian-Doll/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Russian-Doll/thumb.jpg"}
