I grew up on NES and SNES games, and the old 8-bit and 16-bit technology is just nostalgia to me. I loved it, and still do. Now that I'm in my upper teens, I am able to enjoy everything this show has to offer, and not just the appearance...although the appearance in and of itself is extremely enjoyable as well.\n\nThe show rules, man. Inventive characters and good voice acting combined with out-of-the-park hilarity and a plethora of references to early gaming makes this show one of the absolute funniest I have ever seen. It's something that you don't have to be extremely in-tune with the gaming community to enjoy, and yet being part of it makes the show all the more enjoyable.\n\nSome people may not like it because of its odd and sometimes inappropriate humor, some may not like it because it reminds them of that one level that they just couldn't beat when they were an acne-infested junior in high school, dropping quarter after quarter into that dang machine to no avail. And some may not like it because they simply can't be pleased.\n\nThankfully, I am not one of those people. This show gets a 10/10 for me. I certainly hope that they continue with the show and make more seasons of the fine, fine product that is Code Monkeys.\n\n*GAME OVER*", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Code Monkeys: Season One", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3296902425", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMwYmNmYjEtY2U4OC00MDdhLWFmYTctZjc5MWQ4MTA5ODMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMwYmNmYjEtY2U4OC00MDdhLWFmYTctZjc5MWQ4MTA5ODMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Code Monkeys: Season One", "uploadDate": "2019-03-18T00:09:32Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068683", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Code-Monkeys", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Code-Monkeys/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Code-Monkeys/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Code-Monkeys/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
