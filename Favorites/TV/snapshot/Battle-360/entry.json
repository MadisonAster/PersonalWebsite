First of all, Saburo Sakai, the Japanese fighter ace was wounded; however, in his book Samurai, he stated that he was attacking a group of F4F Wildcats. However, he saw them bundle close together and when he came closer and closer to the formation, he saw that they were TBM Avenger torpedo bombers. The bombers tighten their formation so their ball turrets could throw up a wall of fire. Becauase he was going so fast, Saburo had to go right through the formation instead of evading it. The end result was he was wounded as stated in the show.\n\nBefore the encountering the torpedo planes, Sakai did shoot down a Dauntless, and he engage in a dogfight with an F4F Wildcat piloted by James Pug Sutherland for several minutes before shooting him down. These facts were not shown in the show. There was nothing mention in Sakai's book about shooting another F4F Wildcat. The pilot who was shot up by Sakai look a lot younger than those other guys that were telling their stories. \n\nIn the espisode about the Battle of Santa Cruz, they stated that Lt. Stanley Swede Vejtasa shot down 5 Val dive bombers and 2 Kate torpedo planes. Actually, he shot down 2 Val dive bombers and 5 Kate torpedo planes. I don't know why they can't get their facts straight. It makes you wonder how much they are distorting the facts in the war stories.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Military Combat: Relive History's Most Intense Battles: Vol 3", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1626520601", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYyYjllYTMtYmJlNi00NDJiLTkzZTQtZTE2MzdlZDUwOGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTYyYjllYTMtYmJlNi00NDJiLTkzZTQtZTE2MzdlZDUwOGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg", "description": "Military Combat: Relive History's Most Intense Battles: Vol 3", "uploadDate": "2019-04-28T13:09:30Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194698", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Battle-360", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Battle-360/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Battle-360/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Battle-360/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Battle-360/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-09-22"}
