It was gross, vile, simple and lovely fart humor. The storyline was continous throughout the season. The characters mostly had their own arch and developed as the story went on. While it's certainly not for everyone, I loved it.\n\nThen season 2 happened. All the characters were flat, repetitive and one dimensional. The story was a weaker variant of s1, just worse. It offered nothing new and basically is a watered down version of s1. Shame, had hoped for more.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8235236", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Paradise-Pd", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Paradise-Pd/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Paradise-Pd/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Paradise-Pd/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Paradise-Pd/thumb.jpg"}
