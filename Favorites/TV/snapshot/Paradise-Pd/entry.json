Sooo, my fear is this show, being equally offensive, will again not last for very long, even though its on Netflix, who aren't as concerned with the outrage of snowflakes as TV stations. \n\nBut other than that, its a pretty fun show - offensive, hella funny, so I wholeheartedly recommend it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8235236", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Paradise-Pd", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Paradise-Pd/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Paradise-Pd/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Paradise-Pd/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
