Some achieve truly iconic status, such as Rick and Morty, Family guy or Southpark. Most of others can't get there, so they keep on trying new things. It feels as this show niche is being anti-PC (which is good), shock humor, which mainly focused on sex stuff. While it's still decent and gives you a few laughs, sometimes it feels as they try too hard to get some shock-laughs, even when it doesn't feel as they should be there. There is a clear decline in quality from season 1, yet I would like to see what will happen further down the road.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8235236", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Paradise-Pd", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Paradise-Pd/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Paradise-Pd/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Paradise-Pd/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Paradise-Pd/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
