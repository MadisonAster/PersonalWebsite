But, it highlighted so much that I've never seen on television before and was arguably one of the best scripted and acted series of 2015.\n\nSeason 2 is on a whole other level. Just a few episodes in and this series shows how all series should follow-up to previous acclaim. This season has one of the most original and intriguing plots I've seen in ages. I predict this season will also earn several Emmy nominations. \n\nWhat really stands out in this series other than its acting and script, is that it greatly focuses on race, gender and gender roles, sexuality, drugs, wealth, power and status.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2 Promo", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1363653145", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4NjQ3NTQ1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg2OTc1NzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4NjQ3NTQ1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg2OTc1NzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "First look at Season 2 of American Crime on ABC.", "uploadDate": "2015-12-29T09:58:14Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3488298", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Crime-2015", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Crime-2015/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Crime-2015/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Crime-2015/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Crime-2015/thumb.jpg"}
