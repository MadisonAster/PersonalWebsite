It irks me to see people who hate this show and are glad it is cancelled.  If you don't like a show just don't watch it...to many shows have gotten a premature axe these days mainly cause television networks haven't realized no show is going to have the ratings of shows from the past.  I am sure to all those who hated the show, there have been shows you liked that have been cancelled as well.  This one about a pizza boy frozen and waking up in the future was for me quite enjoyable.  Which is the kiss of death right there, because if I like a show, it usually does get cancelled and it usually does have a pretty good following, but for some reason the networks still somehow think all shows should average 20 or more million viewers or its a failure."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Futurama: Volume One", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2429813529", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWQ2MDliZjItYjgzNC00OGJhLWFjMjUtNTAzODgwMTllMzM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWQ2MDliZjItYjgzNC00OGJhLWFjMjUtNTAzODgwMTllMzM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment", "uploadDate": "2009-01-01T06:40:35Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149460", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Futurama", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Futurama/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Futurama/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Futurama/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Futurama/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-08-19"}
