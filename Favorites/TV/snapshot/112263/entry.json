Last time when I saw him so good was in 127 Hours. He has done complete justice to the character in the premiere of this show and seems to be in his comfort zone. \n\nAs for the show, it does not waste any time to get into action. Franco plays role of Jake Epping, a High School Teacher, who unwillingly has to take up the task of traveling to the past and avoid assassination of JFK. Show is fast paced and keeps you engrossed all the time. You just keep wondering how the story will unfold and will Jake be able to prevent the assassination. \n\nFor the premiere, you do not see much of the acting of others as it revolves only around Franco and Cooper. But they both take you to a ride which should not end. Episode was 80mins long but I did not realize when the time flew by. Direction and screenplay is of high standards along with story which is very well thought of. \n\nI personally recommend you to watch the show and guarantee that you will not be disappointed.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer #1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi313242905", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NzI5MzcyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODAzNjg2NzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NzI5MzcyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODAzNjg2NzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "High school teacher Jake Epping travels back in time to prevent the assassination of President John F.
