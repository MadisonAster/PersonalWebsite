The issues that the show grapples with and illuminates in each episode are timely and significant. To say that this show deals with the dark side of technology and human nature is to make to simple of a comparison. The stories are mostly set in a dystopian world that is dominated or badly influenced by modern technology. What makes \"Black mirror\" so great is the attention to detail and inter/intrapersonal relationships and how the main character would feel and experience its brave new world. Well thought out plots, characters, settings and really good storytelling. It asks some hard questions of what and where we really want technology to take us. Or maybe already have taken us. Definitely worth seeing! Treat yourself and watch this. 9/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "\"Striking Vipers\" Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1456913433", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTlhZGU5ZWMtZWY4ZS00Y2VhLTg0YzUtMzEwN2Q2M2E0Yzc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTlhZGU5ZWMtZWY4ZS00Y2VhLTg0YzUtMzEwN2Q2M2E0Yzc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Two estranged college friends reunite in later life, triggering a series of events that could alter their lives forever.", "uploadDate": "2019-05-21T15:40:58Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Mirror", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Mirror/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Mirror/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Mirror/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Mirror/thumb.jpg"}
