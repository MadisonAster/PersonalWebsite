The premise: taking contemporary phenomena (ranging from the wild popularity of talent shows on TV to the impact of social media and smartphones on our lives) as a starting point and speculate how such phenomena could/would evolve in the future. Each episode tells a different story with different protagonists and focuses on a different theme. Of course, the series doesn't explore the beneficial aspects or any positive trends - (where would the fun be in that?) - but clearly approaches its topics from a pessimistic, cynical point of view (hence the title). As the show's creator Charlie Brooker ('Dead Set') puts it: \"...They (the different stories) are all about the way we live now \u2013 and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy.\"\n\nThe resulting mix of bleak sci-fi, drama, satire and black comedy makes for highly intelligent Television and ranks among the most original and entertaining shows I've ever come across. The writing and directing are excellent and the cast includes such talented thesps as Domhnall Gleeson, Rory Kinnear, Toby Kebbell, Hayley Atwell, Jon Hamm, Jason Flemyng and Rupert Everett - to name but a few. Unique, fascinating and highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "\"Striking Vipers\" Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1456913433", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTlhZGU5ZWMtZWY4ZS00Y2VhLTg0YzUtMzEwN2Q2M2E0Yzc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTlhZGU5ZWMtZWY4ZS00Y2VhLTg0YzUtMzEwN2Q2M2E0Yzc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Two estranged college friends reunite in later life, triggering a series of events that could alter their lives forever.", "uploadDate": "2019-05-21T15:40:58Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2085059", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Mirror", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Mirror/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Mirror/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Black-Mirror/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-03-29"}
