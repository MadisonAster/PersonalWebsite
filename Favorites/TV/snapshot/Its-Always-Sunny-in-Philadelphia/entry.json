In most cases, these shows are being deservingly dumped in the summer because most of them are terrible. Surprisingly, \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\", which premiered earlier this month, is not terrible. Even though it seemed like it might have been, it ended up being one of the better shows to come along so far in the 2000s. The show is about four friends who own a bar in Philadelphia. At first glance, it doesn't seem like anything special. The owning a bar scenario has been done several times before in a variety of other sitcoms including \"Cheers\" and the recently canceled \"Grounded For Life\". However, since the show is more clever and much funnier than the previous sitcoms who have used the device, one can forgive the lack of originality.\n\nWhat makes \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" better than any other of the sitcoms that are on today is the clever writing. The writing on sitcoms these days is beyond awful. The writing on \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" is great. In fact, if the show doesn't receive an Emmmy nomination for writing, there is no justice in the world. The three episodes that have aired so far have been incredibly well written and unlike with most sitcoms, the dialogue doesn't seem like typical sitcom dialogue. The dialogue comes across as natural as opposed to coming across as forced like on network sitcoms and other cable comedies. The writers are also the stars and executive producers of the show, which gives them almost complete control. Let's hope the writing staff doesn't change. I'd give \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" 9/10. It's one of the best shows one is ever likely to see on cable."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 11 Teaser - \"Ideas\"", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi611693081", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNzUzMjc3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjYxNTM1NzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNzUzMjc3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjYxNTM1NzE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Season 11 teaser for It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia on FXX.", "uploadDate": "2015-12-22T13:05:11Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472954", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Its-Always-Sunny-in-Philadelphia", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Its-Always-Sunny-in-Philadelphia/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Its-Always-Sunny-in-Philadelphia/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Its-Always-Sunny-in-Philadelphia/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Its-Always-Sunny-in-Philadelphia/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
