I love the edgy humor and how they're addressing everyday issues and finding the hilarity in them. I think what I enjoy the most is that they're not tip-toeing around issues, gay, abortion, underage drinking (no, they're not promoting these, they're just addressing them). The way they have the real life situations and the true reactions within a set of friends sets this show apart (Seinfeld anyone?)...there's no following the lives of multi-millionaire brats as lead characters (fill in the blank for that show, there's only about 5 on air right now), none of the worn out \"the city is going to blow up unless you catch the bad guy in 5 minutes\" plot lines...it's real situations and almost everyone can relate...and laugh at."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "description": "Season 11 teaser for It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia on FXX.", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi611693081", "name": "Season 11 Teaser - \"Ideas\"", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNzUzMjc3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjYxNTM1NzE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNzUzMjc3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjYxNTM1NzE@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2015-12-22T13:05:11Z"}, "url": "/title/tt0472954/", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-23"}
