I hope to be a contestant one day. Obviously, Ken Jennings's winning streak was beyond impressive, and the \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" spoofs on \"Saturday Night Live\" are priceless. But it all dates back to this show's premise of forming the answer as a question. It must be really fun coming up with the answers.\n\nI will say that the Clue Crew is unnecessary. But either way, I still say that this is the best game show ever. Alex Trebek is one heckuva host.
