The new faces and the thoughtfulness of the director/editor was obvious, remaining to catch moments that were in a kind of elegant contrast to the often crude and totally crazy stories.\n\nIt lost a star for me because the opening theme felt a little MTV and the cliffhanger style a little TLC .. also because I didn't know some people, their professions - their band names .. it might be nice to hear this stuff or read it onscreen, maybe for them to talk about their 'claims to fame' before cannonballing into their party lore.\n\nOtherwise, awesome.
