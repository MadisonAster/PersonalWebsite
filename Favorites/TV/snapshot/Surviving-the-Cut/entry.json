Each hour-length episode focuses on a particular branch of the armed forces.\n\nThe production quality is high with concise narration. It manages to show the gritty details and hardships that come from such a high stress training environment without becoming boring.\n\nI think the show is best suited to those with an interest in how things work. It probably caters mainly to a male audience.\n\nIf you like this show you may also like:\n\n\n* Man vs Wild\n\n\n\n* Full Metal Jacket\n", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1711419", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Surviving-the-Cut", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Surviving-the-Cut/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Surviving-the-Cut/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Surviving-the-Cut/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Surviving-the-Cut/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-08-21"}
