            'reviewBody': "I've watched Frontline nearly since its debut in "
                          '1983. Specifically I remember watching a program on '
                          'a clash in Greensboro, North Carolina, between '
                          'communist labor organizers and white supremacists. '
                          'That program focused on a white-supremacist '
                          'informant, and how the police treated and used his '
                          'information. It was a documentary that, for myself, '
                          "for the first time didn't take sides. It presented "
                          'testimony by the participants, and made no attempt '
                          'to guide the thoughts and feelings of the viewers. '
                          "It was the first time I'd ever seen a prgram that "
                          'let me think and feel the way I wanted to about a '
                          'subject. That was twenty years ago, and Frontline '
                          'has continued to produce fantastic in-depth '
                          'documanteries to this day.\n'
                          '\n'
                          "Frontline's programs have ranged from geo-politics "
                          'to so-called "adult films," to equal rights, to the '
                          'battle in Mogadishu, to whatever intriguing subject '
                          "one can think of. And it's all done with the aim of "
                          'informing and educating the viewer on how said '
                          'subject is treated and perceived by those '

                          '\n'
                          'Unlike other documentaries Frontline merely reports '
                          'the facts without pushing an agenda (unlike so many '
                          'other one shot documentaries). Frontline lets you '
                          'make up your own mind by presenting testimony of '
                          "the people involved. It's a program whose narration "
                          "isn't filled with conclusions worded to sound like "
                          'fact (again, unlike many other documentaries). '
                          'Instead it relies heavily on an interview format, '
                          'where the answer to questions by the people '
                          'involved are presented without being edited or '

                          'and not processed narration, then Frontline is the '
                          'program to watch. Not all of its documentary '
                          'reports will appeal to everyone, but rest assured '
