This is one of the best 'First Contact' genres ever made. No movie on the big screen so far - no, not Independence Day or even Close Encounters of the Third Kind (amongst my favorite films, I might add) have been able to give you the kind of goose pimples that watching 'V' gave me.\n\nThe ensemble cast with Marc Singer, Faye Grant, Jane Badler and others have done a fantastic job and Kenneth Johnson has done a superb job making this show. Not only is the storyline and plot very capturing, the characters in this really come to life and you actually get involved with them unlike many other shows. And this is even more amazing because there are SO MANY characters and each one of them has their own story which is depicted very well. I love the way the characters all start off in different settings and events and don't know each other, but gradually they come together.\n\nThe Nazi-esquire theme also works out well. The special effects for 1983 are cool enough to be used today and the lasagnas on 'V' are the absolutely coolest ones ever. Better than Star Trek 'phasers' or Star Wars 'blasters'. Not to mention the Mother Ships and the various classes of shuttles.\n\nThis is a good one and this is certainly something I am hoping they give more. Either a movie or a remake. There is supposed to be a 'V-The next generation' in the making. I can hardly wait!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085106", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/V", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/V/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/V/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/V/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/V/thumb.jpg"}
