However back in the 80's many TV movies were brilliant including this one. \"V\" takes you on an adventure where some aliens try to become friendly with humans and then rip us off. Except they're not after our silverware or jewelry they want the real important stuff like water, and I'm not talking about a couple gallons of Evian. I am talking about the entire world supply. Take time to enjoy a mini-series that will stand for all time. Great performances by all players. Kudos to Marc Singer.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "6"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085106", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/V", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/V/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/V/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/V/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-02-25"}
