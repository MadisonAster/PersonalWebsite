Even the uniforms of the V soldiers is very similar to the storm trooper soldiers of the Nazi and they use the same Red and Black colors.\n\nSame way that the Nazi's used hope for the future to help influence the population the V's used a cure for things like cancer and other ailments. Early terrorist attacks on the V's were blamed on scientists in the same manner that the Nazi's did the same to communists.
