Then I really knew the face. (I own the DVD sets of \"Blackadder\" (starring Robinson, Rowan Atkinson, and Hugh Laurie) Robinson is serious and sometimes humorous in presenting the program that makes British History interesting. He explains and participates in doing these actual jobs and it is fascinating. In \"Maritime,\" they also show photos of women gutting fish. Of course people still do that today. But the most overlooked and dangerous jobs are those of the \"stokers\" in the ships boilers and the ones of people who actually built the lighthouses.\n\nIn the USA we have the program \"Dirty Jobs,\" so we can certainly appreciate what people do to earn a living. It's also sobering to those of us who have lousy, low-paying jobs but don't also have to soil our hands or risk our lives to do them.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10", "worstRating": "1"}}, "url": "/title/tt0423775/"}
