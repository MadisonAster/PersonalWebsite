I've always thought due to past shows on these eras that I may have enjoyed living in these times, but with the reality shown on this documentary may have to recant my former wishes. The reality of these times although sobering, is at times too funny. Tony puts himself right into it, really great, I would watch it again and again. I would like to order it to watch with friends and family. I can see that much research went into the making of this documentary, and traveling. Do the people he interviewed live this or are they part of reenactments? Thank you so much to the producers, directors and Tony for this educational entertainment, why couldn't history class have been this way?"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423775", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Worst-Jobs-in-History", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Worst-Jobs-in-History/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Worst-Jobs-in-History/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Worst-Jobs-in-History/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-08-14"}
