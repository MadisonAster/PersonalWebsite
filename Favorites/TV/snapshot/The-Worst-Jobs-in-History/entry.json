Robinson's chummy, honest style of presenting makes the history real and accessible. I've seen three episodes, and hope there are more out there. There's an element of \"Fear Factor\" (Tony gags as he trods on wool cloth in a vat of stale human urine), and also some really revealing emotional moments, as in the \"egg-gathering\", and the \"headsman\".\n\nMost \"history-rich\" documentaries tend to leave a lot of viewers cold, being all facts, dates, and places. This series humanizes the history, and affords us an insight into the day-to-day struggle of common folks, such as ourselves.\n\nNo matter how bad your job may be, I think it's easy to say that it doesn't compare to \"The Worst Jobs in History\"."}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0423775", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Worst-Jobs-in-History", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Worst-Jobs-in-History/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Worst-Jobs-in-History/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Worst-Jobs-in-History/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Worst-Jobs-in-History/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-08-14"}
