It is by all means a show for a man. At least 40% of the show is sex and nudity, and 50% of the show is fighting, and within that 90%, there are many scenes that contain sex, nudity, and fighting together. With that said, the plot line is still very strong, and the acting is great. It is not the sex aspect as much as the fighting and plot line that drawls me to this show. Honestly, even without all the sex, I would still love the show, and I think my wife may like it more, but I understand that sex and nudity was a big aspect of the time frame, thus it is a big aspect of the show. I would highly recommend checking this one out if you like Roman war movies and shows, the acting makes this one of the best available.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Spartacus: Gods of the Arena", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3829700889", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NDQwNTg3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk4NjExNA@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NDQwNTg3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjk4NjExNA@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "A preview trailer for the Starz original series \"Spartacus: Gods of the Arena,\" premiering January 21, 2011.", "uploadDate": "2010-11-20T13:01:34Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1758429", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Spartacus-Gods-of-the-Arena", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Spartacus-Gods-of-the-Arena/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Spartacus-Gods-of-the-Arena/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Spartacus-Gods-of-the-Arena/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Spartacus-Gods-of-the-Arena/thumb.jpg"}
