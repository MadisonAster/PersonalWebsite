One of the best, and most accurate, dramatizations of real events I've ever seen.\n\nI was 20 years old when the real trial was happening, and like the rest of the world I was glued to my TV screen for the whole event. So when I started watching this dramatization, I was immediately transported back to that time. \n\nAs I watched the series through (for the first time), I was so blown away by its historical accuracy that I decided to simultaneously re-watch the corresponding real archive footage on Youtube after each episode, and could find no fault with the dramatized version.\n\nI've just finished re-watching this series again, after a long gap, without additional archive viewing, and it surprised me how much my mind has inadvertently merged the real events with the dramatized ones, to the point that I can no longer reliably separate the two. That, for me, demonstrates how successful the filmmakers were in their recreations.\n\nThe only thing that lets the dramatized version down is the casting of Cuba Gooding Jr, which despite an unsurprisingly mesmerising performance, is nevertheless unconvincing due to the total lack of any resemblance to the real OJ. But that is a minor gripe in an otherwise exceptional drama series. From start to finish this was a gripping and utterly rewarding show.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6205862", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Inside-Look-The-People-V-Oj-Simpson---American-Crime-Story", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Inside-Look-The-People-V-Oj-Simpson---American-Crime-Story/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Inside-Look-The-People-V-Oj-Simpson---American-Crime-Story/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Inside-Look-The-People-V-Oj-Simpson---American-Crime-Story/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Inside-Look-The-People-V-Oj-Simpson---American-Crime-Story/thumb.jpg"}
