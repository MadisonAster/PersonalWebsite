                          'O.J. Simpson. But that does not mean I knew the '
                          'full story. Occasionally I read something about it, '
                          'but I never got the whole history. This show gave '

                          'shows. The first one is the acting. John Travolta, '

                          'show. But also the other lead characters are '
                          "amazing. I'm just not sure if I found Cuba Gooding "

                          'quite spot on. But during the trial that changed in '
                          'my opinion. I cannot quite finger point exactly '
