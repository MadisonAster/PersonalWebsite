                          'the court ruled that a defendant deserved '
                          'professional representation irrelevant of the '

                          'for representation. The public fascination of the '

                          'was more closely aligned with the Charles Lindbergh '

                          'as Gil Garcetti. The film brings us into the '
                          'behind-the-scenes drama of this compelling episode '
                          'in American legal theater. The film does an '
                          'outstanding job of giving us, the audience, the '
                          'juxtaposition between what was given to the '
                          'American public and how the main players decided '

                          'and the public at large. The film begins with '
                          'footage from the Rodney King case and the ensuing '
                          'race riots which erupted in Los Angels in the wake '

                          'identified as Nicole Brown Simpson, the owner of '
                          'the house, and another friend, Ronald Goldman. '
                          'Detectives arrived to the scene and were eventually '
                          'informed that Nicole was the ex-wife of American '
                          'Football and film actor O.J. Simpson (Gooding), '
                          'nicknamed "The Juice". Simpson was in Chicago but '
                          'then took a red-eye flight back to Los Angeles to '

                          '(Travolta), begin to suspect that Los Angeles is '
                          'planning to arrest and charge Simpson for the '

                          '"dream team" as it came to be called. On another '
                          'front, we learn of an African-American attorney '
                          'name of Johnny Cochran who had made a reputation '
                          'for representing African-Americans against legal '
                          'injustices. Cochran had also represented '
                          'celebrities, notably Michael Jackson.\n'

                          'Live". Eventually, Cochran joins the team. The team '
                          'at first is an odd mix of Kardashian, Shapiro and '

                          'regarding who will represent Simpson as lead '
                          'counsel. Simpson opts for Cochran to the dismay of '
                          'the other white lawyers.\n'

                          'putting together their case against Simpson which '
                          'appears to be iron-clad. She wants to be lead '
                          'prosecutor and she polls some African-American '
                          'women and the results suggest that a white '

                          '(Greenwood) feels the prosecution looks too '
                          '"white". The trial will be held in downtown Los '
                          'Angeles, and there would undoubtedly be '
                          'African-American jurors. They find a solution: they '

                          'work, it is learned that Fuhrman is a racist and '

                          'Definitely a compelling series from beginning to '

                          'miscast: Cuba Gooding as O.J. Simpson. I will '
                          'preface this to say I am great admirer of Gooding '
                          'who has had some terrific performances. However, he '
                          'was not a good choice for O.J. Simpson. I think the '
                          'problem is that Gooding, unlike O.J. has a very '
                          'strong personality and a high-pitched tenor voice. '
                          'O.J. has a softer but resonant baritone voice and '
                          'in interviews he always came off as very calm and '
                          '"comfortable" in his own "skin". Not that the O.J. '
                          "behind the scenes couldn't be fiery, but Gooding is "
                          'almost too fiery, with a lot of whining and nervous '
                          'angst which happens all the way through the film. '
                          'Sometimes I found Gooding a bit over-the-top.\n'
                          '\n'
                          'Sadly, Gooding is just not a terribly convincing '
                          'O.J. I felt like I kept seeing the actor rather '
                          'than one of the biggest sports and media stars of '

                          'pass as brothers, not even cousins. For one thing, '
                          'Simpson would dwarf Gooding, and the former '
                          "football star's head is rather ovular and nearly "

                          "is better than the other). The issue is that we've "
                          'seen O.J. so much, especially on television during '
