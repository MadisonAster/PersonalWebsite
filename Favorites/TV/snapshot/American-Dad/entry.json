The characters and humor are on the same sort of level as family guy but Seth McFarlane managed to work his magic and create a whole new different level of humor and wit for this show which sets itself apart from family guy.\n\nA secret service FBI agent, prone to overreacting must find a way to use his skills to help his family and their new illegal alien housemate with basic troubles in life. Problem is sometimes it proves too much with hilarious results.\n\nRemember this isn't a kid's show and I guess thats what makes this and family guy so special. They can put in all the added toilet humor it needs and the writers seem to know how to do it perfectly. The characters are great but the main character Stan Smith stands out above all the rest (With their alien friend coming in a close second). Anyone who wants a laugh, drop everything and watch this."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "American Dad!: Volume Five", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2612763417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAzYmQzOTAtNzI2Zi00NjBlLTk5ZDgtYzdiMTU3ZjQ5NGUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAzYmQzOTAtNzI2Zi00NjBlLTk5ZDgtYzdiMTU3ZjQ5NGUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for American Dad!: Volume Five", "uploadDate": "2010-12-21T06:05:39Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397306", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Dad", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Dad/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Dad/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Dad/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Dad/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-01-30"}
