Probably because the humour most of the time was more adult-friendly and not for kids. But in these last years I watched lots of episodes and I liked them. And I am proud of having given the show a chance.\n\nAt first, it looks very similar to FAMILY GUY (the other great Seth McFarlane TV show), mainly because Stan Smith, although not selfish and loud as Peter Griffin, manages to be the perfect dad. While Roger the alien and Klaus the fish are much more similar to Brian and Stewie. The flashbacks and cultural references are almost absent and the episodes' plots are more non-interrupted than in the other show.\n\nThe animation is very good, and the backgrounds are very warm, I mean, even more than the ones from FAMILY GUY. The theme song is the best part of the soundtrack, and no words can describe how much I love it. And the voice cast is good, especially Seth McFarlane as Stan Smith and Roger the alien (my favourite characters), and I find Klaus' German accent very funny.\n\nOverall, a great animated sitcom and I recommend it to everybody, and I am sure that if you love THE SIMPSONS, FAMILY GUY, FUTURAMA and SOUTH PARK you'll love this show too. It's very similar to all of them and perfect to watch with your family or friends.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "American Dad!: Volume Five", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2612763417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAzYmQzOTAtNzI2Zi00NjBlLTk5ZDgtYzdiMTU3ZjQ5NGUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAzYmQzOTAtNzI2Zi00NjBlLTk5ZDgtYzdiMTU3ZjQ5NGUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for American Dad!: Volume Five", "uploadDate": "2010-12-21T06:05:39Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0397306", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Dad", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Dad/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Dad/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Dad/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-01-30"}
