                          'on beliefs, morals and ideals and really bringing '

                          'is dealing with in different ways as well. This is '
                          'definitely not a comedy although it can be funny at '
                          'times. The still camera shot style of filming makes '
                          'it feel like a theatrical drama and it is very '

                          'audience. The show is slow paced, utilizes lots of '
                          'long shots of dialogue and could only be pulled off '
                          'with top notch scripting, casting and acting, and '
