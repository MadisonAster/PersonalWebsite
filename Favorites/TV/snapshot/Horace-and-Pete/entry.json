With the exception of some small glitches in sound (occasional ambient echo, one surprising mic tap) production succeeds in mainlining the product straight into the vein. Lots of long takes, dialog that's so direct and lively and full-on it's like latching on to a freight train. An absolute delight to see fine acting talent, new and old, invited to participate in the spectacle, and all take their direction well and otherwise rise to the occasion. Sets and props are great, lighting is balanced and nice on the eyes.\n\nIt's funny because normally the first sign of good production is that you don't notice the production. But, trust me, my reflections on production (beside the minor sound issues) are an afterthought.\n\nThe important thing is that we get a story. And what a story! That's all I need to say; no need to spoil anything. Duck in and hang on tight.\n\nOne odd remonstrance: Let's face it: Louis can't stretch. But he can be forgiven in this case. His standard issue character is on-target, and you sometimes sort of bask, in a backgrounded way, in the realization that this is his labor of love.\n\nCheck it out.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5425186", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Horace-and-Pete", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Horace-and-Pete/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Horace-and-Pete/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Horace-and-Pete/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Horace-and-Pete/thumb.jpg"}
