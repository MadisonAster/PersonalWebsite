Period", "reviewBody": "This is the finest show ever produced for TV. Each episode is a triumph. The casting, the writing, the timing are all second to none. This cast performs miracles. \n\nThe secret to this show is that it is, at heart, a comedy, even when tragic things are happening. That gives Martin Sheen, Allison Janney, Bradley Whitford, Richard Schiff et al. the room to work. And do they ever.\n\nIt works because it is deep, the characters are well-drawn. Early in the first season, CJ gets a root canal and walks around for the rest of the episode with cotton stuffed in her mouth, yelling things like\" The Pwesident must be bweefed!\" This has to be seen to be believed. It had me literally on the floor, laughing until I feared I would hurt myself. I don't know how many shows have tried cheap stunts like that and they are just that, cheap. On \"The West Wing\" it works because we know CJ, we know how unlike her, and yet like her, that moment is. And Toby's slow-burn reaction is pitch perfect. \n\nBravo."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Trailer Season 1", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3802840601", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdhYWZkNDUtMDU2Zi00NmNmLWE4M2QtNDgwYzZmMThlOGNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdhYWZkNDUtMDU2Zi00NmNmLWE4M2QtNDgwYzZmMThlOGNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2020-03-11T14:28:44Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-West-Wing", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-West-Wing/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-West-Wing/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-West-Wing/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
