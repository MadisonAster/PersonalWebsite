The storyline is original and deals with a lot of issues that other shows won't touch.  It seems that people saw the trailer and drew their own conclusions without actually watching it, and those that did watch took the choice to see what they wanted to see - they saw that a 'fat' girl was being bullied and had her problems solved by becoming 'thin', I saw a girl that lost the weight that society thought she should only to find that it didn't solve anything and actually things became worse, but as this is dealt with a dry sense of humour a lot of people didn't get this. \n\nIf you liked Drop Dead Gorgeous than this is the show for you!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2965682969", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWI2N2VkZWQtYWZmYi00ZmY4LWI1MGYtNmRjOTljOTljMWM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWI2N2VkZWQtYWZmYi00ZmY4LWI1MGYtNmRjOTljOTljMWM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg", "description": "A coming of rage story: \"Insatiable,\" starring Debby Ryan, arrives Aug. 10, 2018, on Netflix.", "uploadDate": "2018-07-19T17:19:47Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6487482", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Insatiable", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Insatiable/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Insatiable/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Insatiable/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Insatiable/thumb.jpg"}
