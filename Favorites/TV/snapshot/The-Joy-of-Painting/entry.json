His methods are made simple, and when watching, you will see a beautiful painting made right in front of you. Sometimes you'll be watching, and you'll think \"man, that looks weird\" and then he does 1 or 2 brush strokes, and instantly it's the coolest thing you've ever seen... it's really too weird. If you've never seen the show, i would suggest that you look for it on your local access or PBS channel. If they don't have it, do as Bob always suggest and \"request\" that they air the show..... \n\nJust beat the devil out of it!! :D"}, "url": "/title/tt0383795/"}
