But here's the thing: I'm not buying his work, I'm watching it happen - and that's precisely where the appeal lies.\n\nHe starts out telling us what we're going to paint today, and it takes a bit to see it on the canvas. One plane of color is layered over another until it's suddenly a landscape. It's his technique that sells this; the way he scrapes in a cloud or a mountain with his palette knife or dots in some fir trees with his fan brush. This blew my mind as a kid - these methods would never have occurred to me when painting trees, mountains, what-have-you, and it's still enjoyable as an adult.\n\nWhat I really like about this is his attitude. It's not just folksy expressions, but the idea that this is fun, it's spontaneous and (most importantly) that we're painting this together. That sense of inclusion is gratifying, even if I'm not actually painting along with him. His is such a likable personality, just a laid back approachable presence.\n\nIt's very easy to get lost in his brush strokes; there's a serious hypnotic quality to this show. It doesn't matter what Ross is painting because it's always fun to watch.\n\nAnd I would totally buy his work.\n\n8/10", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0383795", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Joy-of-Painting", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Joy-of-Painting/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Joy-of-Painting/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Joy-of-Painting/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2014-08-21"}
