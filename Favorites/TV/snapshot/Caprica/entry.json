I also love the fact that apart from Eric Stoltz I didn't recognise one person - this is refreshing, much like BSG. It has introduced me to a whole wealth of new talent - can't wait for the series to start airing. Well done to Ronald D. Moore and team - excellent job. The special effects, dialogue and acting were all spot on, and I felt emotionally tied up in the storyline. I know there are purists out there that will probably disagree with my assessment, but I felt that Caprica was far superior to most of the Sci-Fi stuff produced in the last decade.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Caprica: Season 1.0", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi2855180569", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MGU3ZWEtZmViYy00ZjM5LWFmM2EtYmQxYzc4M2IyYTIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MGU3ZWEtZmViYy00ZjM5LWFmM2EtYmQxYzc4M2IyYTIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Trailer for Caprica: Season 1.0", "uploadDate": "2010-10-15T03:09:40Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0799862", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Caprica", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Caprica/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Caprica/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Caprica/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-06-30"}
