It's been a while since I laughed that hard. I'd like to address a lot of the other reviews saying that it is not funny and unrealistic.\n\nI feel that people rating this show badly have just been formatted by all the other series and movies. They are expecting a deep story and realism... I think they may have been mislead by Zooey Deschanel thinking it was going to be a lot more mature. It doesn't differ much from the big bang theory or How I Met your Mother in term of style. If anything it is better. But I don't see how you can not appreciate these characters. Saying they are unrealistic is like saying the ocean is full of water... It's a comedy TV show, not real life. So it's not a valid point in my opinion.\n\nYou should take it for what it is. They are very caricatured characters but it doesn't stop you from getting attached to their unique personality. I hope people don't get discouraged from giving it a chance because of the low reviews.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 6 New Girl--What's New", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1436923417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzMTU3Nzc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA0NTg5OTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzMTU3Nzc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA0NTg5OTE@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2016-09-10T03:58:55Z"}, "Title": "New Girl", "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1826940", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/New-Girl", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/New-Girl/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/New-Girl/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/New-Girl/entry.json"}
