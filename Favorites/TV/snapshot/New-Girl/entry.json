Jess(Zooey) is so endearing and funny, some people are saying it's same show different actors, but really what show is this like? It's similar to three's company from 30 years ago. I really hope this show makes it, Zooey Deschanel is perfect for this character. This is the first review I've written, I check out a lot of shows but I really only enjoy a few and this is one. I was just appalled at what people were saying about this show. Sure I could take or leave the other guys in the show but maybe with time they will grow on you. Nick isn't so bad."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 6 New Girl--What's New", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1436923417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzMTU3Nzc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA0NTg5OTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzMTU3Nzc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA0NTg5OTE@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2016-09-10T03:58:55Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1826940", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/New-Girl", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/New-Girl/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/New-Girl/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/New-Girl/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/New-Girl/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
