IT will certainly put you in a good mood and you'll find yourself laughing while watching it.\n\nThe characters are incredibly well-written, each one of them having a back story that is easy to keep up with and very believable. It doesn't take long for us to feel like we're also living in this apartment where Jess moves in after being cheated on by her boyfriend. Soon enough, you'll be feeling like these characters are your friends too and you know them well. Each one of them has their particularities; they all have different personalities and obsessions that make them unique and set them apart from each other.\n\nThe fact that there's some plot development throughout the series makes it an interesting show to actually follow and not just watch once in a while. We also see some character development, changes in the characters' personalities that make us either proud or disappointed. \n\nTruth is, there's no chance this show won't leave a mark on you. It's funny, but still intelligent. It's not some dumb show that simply aims at making the viewer laugh. The jokes are not corny and the events are not random. This is one comedy show like no other: The characters are not stereotyped, and the storyline is not typical and easily foreseeable. \n\nGive this show a chance. You won't regret it.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 6 New Girl--What's New", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1436923417", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzMTU3Nzc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA0NTg5OTE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzMTU3Nzc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODA0NTg5OTE@._V1_.jpg", "uploadDate": "2016-09-10T03:58:55Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1826940", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/New-Girl", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/New-Girl/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/New-Girl/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/New-Girl/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
