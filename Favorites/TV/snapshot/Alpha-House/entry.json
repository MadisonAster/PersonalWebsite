I noticed that some reviewers have said that the characters are Democrats playing Republicans but I don't think that is fair. I am old enough to remember when our political parties were not so beholding to outside money and that I had a sense that both parties were working in good faith. It's not that way now. Whatever, I enjoy this show because I see how it relates to how our politicians, GOP and Democrat, and the media work. But in a humorous vein. It's not overly cynical. I found myself admitting that I would vote for Biggs because he is reasonable. I believe that this is what Trudeau has in mind. The GOP has been taken over by right-wing extremist who answer only to big money, i.e. Koch Brothers. I hope it comes back for many seasons to come.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi149597977", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTEwNjk5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY1MTQ5MjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTEwNjk5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY1MTQ5MjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Four Republican senators share the same D.C. house rental, and face re-election battles, looming indictments, and parties -- all with a sense of humor.", "uploadDate": "2014-10-11T14:18:04Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3012160", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Alpha-House", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Alpha-House/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Alpha-House/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Alpha-House/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Alpha-House/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-12-15"}
