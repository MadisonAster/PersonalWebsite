I enjoy pretty much everything that's aired, with a few exceptions. This is one of them.\n\nThe skits seem to be rough drafts for ideas that could be funny if properly written acted or directed, and that's being nice about it. Other skits seem to be rough drafts for ideas that could never be funny regardless. \n\nI do not consider myself above toilet humor, but this show seems to contain some sort of childish humor in every laugh.\n\nSkit shows are generally failures, Dave Chapelle had a really nice format with some sort of a standup performance, introducing us to the skits and giving us a backstory behind them sometimes either before or after. And the skits had a laugh track as a result, in the style of Saturday night live.\n\nThe combination of no laugh track to tell us when to laugh, combined with the fact that it's really not that funny add up to an awkward viewing experience. As with anything else, it gets more awkward with more people watching.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "3"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1721648", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Nick-Swardsons-Pretend-Time", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Nick-Swardsons-Pretend-Time/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Nick-Swardsons-Pretend-Time/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Nick-Swardsons-Pretend-Time/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Nick-Swardsons-Pretend-Time/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-10-06"}
