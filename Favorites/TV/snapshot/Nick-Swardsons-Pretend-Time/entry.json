Point in case, Family Guy. I'm sad to say this will be one of those shows that is AMAZING but will not get it's due until it's on netflix or something. I loved every episode and tuned in every week to see it. Keep on keepin' on Nick and this show is HILARIOUS! DONUTS MAKE US GO NUTS! and so many other instantly classic quotes that i fear won't be popular until way after the show is aired :( i love this show and wish and hope it doesn't get canceled or hasn't already been canceled. that would be yet another comedy central show they can before it gets it's chance. *sigh*", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1721648", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Nick-Swardsons-Pretend-Time", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Nick-Swardsons-Pretend-Time/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Nick-Swardsons-Pretend-Time/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Nick-Swardsons-Pretend-Time/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-10-06"}
