Penn and Teller do such a good job with this show, and do an even better job of de-bunking con-artists.  Everything from Feng Shue to Magnet Medicine and these people who communicate with the dead (such as John Edward) are de-bunked.  I just watched an episode where Penn and Teller got people to try out a \"Mucas Mask\".  This was a supposed be a beauty treatment/facial massage in which people actually let somebody put snails all over their faces.  You then see these people who have faces covered with nasty slime giving testimonials on how much better their wrinkles looked and how relaxed their face felt.  This was something P&T set up just to show that these testimonials for other cons are not reliable. People can be so stupid, and Penn and Teller do a hilarious job of pointing out how gullible some people are.  I reccomend this show to anybody."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Penn & Teller: Bullshit!
