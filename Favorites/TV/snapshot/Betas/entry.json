Brilliant!", "reviewBody": "Finally someone has done a comedy series about Silicon Valley, and it's good! The show is sort of Entourage in Silicon Valley. Smart, savvy and hilarious! It's not perfect, but better than 95% of what you'll find on TV. \n\nThe show has the same nervous energy that permeates Silicon Valley startup culture. The creators obviously did their homework. They get a lot right, though the drug references are overdone and at times silly. The characters are interesting, though sometimes over the top.\n\nThe show is addicting. Can't wait for the next episode to be uploaded. Netflix and Hulu watch out, Amazon is in the game!", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Main Title", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1362602009", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0Mzc1NzQzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE3MzM2MDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0Mzc1NzQzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE3MzM2MDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch title sequence for the Amazon Studios series \"Betas\".", "uploadDate": "2013-11-16T14:30:49Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3012184", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Betas", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Betas/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Betas/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Betas/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-12-15"}
