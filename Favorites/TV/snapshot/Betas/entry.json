Geeks will love it but not only them. If you are interested in good cultural references, and new technology you will like it. Imagine you have found an app which can change the world, what would you do ? Betas gives us an answer. The actors are all very good. The music is well chosen and fits perfectly to the story. This is very different from big bang theory even if the same public can watch both shows with the same interest. It's indeed a good comedy about friendship and the over connected youth which try to change the world. Some characters will make you think about the movies Jobs or The Social Network. You will witness many funny moments too.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Main Title", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1362602009", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0Mzc1NzQzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE3MzM2MDE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0Mzc1NzQzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE3MzM2MDE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Watch title sequence for the Amazon Studios series \"Betas\".", "uploadDate": "2013-11-16T14:30:49Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3012184", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Betas", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Betas/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Betas/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Betas/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Betas/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-12-15"}
