There are no risks in the jokes. They all consist of two things, 1. Trump is bad. and 2. This was a thing, remember it?\n\nNeither of those really work for me. Make fun of Trump all you want, but do it with a punch line. Most of the time they forget the punchline. Simply not liking him is NOT a punchline. You have to exaggerate something, make it satire, mock it in some way. I don't even care if it's a cruel mockery...so long as it doesn't seem like they are just stating an opinion.\n\nOpinions are NOT jokes.\n\nThe same thing goes with their \"remember this, this was a thing\" jokes...\n\nThey leave you sitting there waiting for them to say something funny about it. You're with them for a little while, \"Yeah I remember it, go on...\" then you realize that, no, that was the joke.\n\nThat's not a joke, that's just asking me to remember something.\n\nAgain, if they had a punch line, if they said something about what they were asking me to remember, then it might be funny...but they don't. The jokes are literally \"this was a thing, laugh at it.\" and that's not funny. It has to be followed up with something.\n\nLike with Trump, an opinion is NOT a joke unless it is followed by something. The same thing with a memory, a memory is NOT a joke in and of itself. They both have to be followed by something", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "TONIGHT", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi973192985", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFiNDIwMGMtZWUxOS00Y2Q5LTkzNjEtMjgxMGZjZjU2MTVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjFiNDIwMGMtZWUxOS00Y2Q5LTkzNjEtMjgxMGZjZjU2MTVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Eddie Murphy returns to \"Saturday Night Live.\" Tonight!", "uploadDate": "2019-12-20T19:11:24Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072562", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Saturday-Night-Live", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Saturday-Night-Live/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Saturday-Night-Live/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Saturday-Night-Live/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2011-10-23"}
