However, I felt that in this documentary there were rather big gaps in reasoning when it comes to story telling. Some of my family members in India were Rajneeshees in the '80s and when juxtaposing their experience and the content of the documentary, it seems to me that the directors omitted large chunks of narrative which would have seemed critical towards Rajneeshees.\n\nFor example, forced sex between higher ranking Rajneeshi officials & kids who were underage was one of biggest scandals that made many parents quit the commune. That never came up in the series. Not even as an unverifiable story. Even if the directors are given the benefit of doubt and it can be said that the information presented had to be completely verifiable and factual, still the overall vibe of the documentary felt very pro-Osho in a natural way.\n\nThe documentary is presented as a half-true but not-at-all-dishonest version of the whole thing. Also, the accounts from Antelope residents felt a bit unenthusiastic. As in, they were documenting the local people just because they 'had to' and otherwise it wouldn't seem balanced and fair. So on the surface, the documentary isn't presenting lies, they did give the Antelope residents an outlet to speak, but implicitly carried on with a heavily pro-Osho narrative by not mentioning a wide range of facts, which otherwise would have changed the course of the whole series.\n\nThe cinematography was stunning and most of the frames looked really artsy and engaging. Post production was well done too and added a dramatic, period-film-ish touch to the visuals. However, background music was a bit too overwhelming for me. There were hardly any shots with bare/natural sound and most of the film came with really filling background score. For example, when they show disciples walking, on the background there's some army-like and patriotic music and it has already primed me and evoked a pre-determined emotion in my mind, even before I get a chance to focus on that scene. I think it affected the objective, non-biased attitude of the documentary and made it a bit-too-drama-movie-like. Something along the lines of, 'the viewer should exactly feel what the director is feeling in this scene'. If the score music was a bit more subtle, it would have left more room for the viewer to absorb the content and decide what to feel for themselves.\n\nThough we'll now never know what 'really' happened in Reajneeshpuram, to get a more holistic idea about the whole thing, along with this documentary I'd recommend watching Ashram in Poona (1981) by Wolfgang Dobrowolny and Fear Is the Master (1983). The latter is on Youtube and has an openly anti-Osho narrative. However, it could interest one with some specific details about why the people of Antelope were wary of him.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "7"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4281907225", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQ4ZmJlZTUtNDI0ZS00OWU3LTk5NjAtZDE0OWRlOTAzOTE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQ4ZmJlZTUtNDI0ZS00OWU3LTk5NjAtZDE0OWRlOTAzOTE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "When the world's most controversial guru builds a utopian city deep in the Oregon desert, conflict with the locals escalates into a national scandal.
