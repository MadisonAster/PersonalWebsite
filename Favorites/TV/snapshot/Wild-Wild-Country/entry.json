This miniseries is definitely another great series from Netflix, a compelling and very interesting story about the enigmatic Indian spiritual leader Osho and his Neo-Sannyas Movement and their relocation to a virtually uninhabited location in the US, creating their own city, and the subsequent 1984 bio-terror attack of many dozens of people being poisoned and a series of attempted murders. The story is perfectly executed and kept me interested and mesmerized me through this bizarre but fascinating cult like movement only to be shocked at the end result of the movement. It was amazing to watch what could have been a beautiful and incredible thing spiraled out of control. A truly unique story very deserving of a watch.\n\nSplit up into 6 parts, we experience the beginnings of the religion/cult/movement in India, to their creation of 15,000 strong city from nothing, to the internal frictions, and the subsequent scandal that forever changed the movement. I remember nothing about this because I had yet to be born when it happened, and even some people much older than me didn't know of this amazing story. The story starts off very spiritual, very positive, almost the creation of a Utopian society. But through careful and meticulous story telling, things begin to unwind and things end badly, something you would have never expected if you went into this with no knowledge of it.\n\nAll in all, a very fascinating story as far as I'm concerned, definitely worth a watch.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4281907225", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQ4ZmJlZTUtNDI0ZS00OWU3LTk5NjAtZDE0OWRlOTAzOTE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQ4ZmJlZTUtNDI0ZS00OWU3LTk5NjAtZDE0OWRlOTAzOTE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "When the world's most controversial guru builds a utopian city deep in the Oregon desert, conflict with the locals escalates into a national scandal.
