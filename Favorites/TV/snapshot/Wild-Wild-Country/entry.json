Her lack of enlightenment by the end is bizarre. The whole purpose of following Osho was supposedly to gain enlightenment. Will the day ever come when she recognises that her need for power created only chaos? \n\nHuman nature in all its frailty plays out on film - everyone should see this - and read Animal Farm, which predicted it all decades ago. Slightly overlong which is the only reason it doesn't get 10 stars - but worth staying with as it truly gets weird halfway through.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi4281907225", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQ4ZmJlZTUtNDI0ZS00OWU3LTk5NjAtZDE0OWRlOTAzOTE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjQ4ZmJlZTUtNDI0ZS00OWU3LTk5NjAtZDE0OWRlOTAzOTE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "When the world's most controversial guru builds a utopian city deep in the Oregon desert, conflict with the locals escalates into a national scandal.
