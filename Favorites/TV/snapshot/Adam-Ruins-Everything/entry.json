Rather than cover that fact he revels in it, making himself the butt of many of the jokes on his social awkwardness, Whether he is like that in real life or not, it's highly entertaining and nice to see him not taking himself too seriously.\n\nThe show presents LOTS of facts in a quick and breezy, and most importantly, entertaining way so that the average viewer won't feel they are getting information overload or be bored. And as unusual as he is, Adam is an engaging host all the way. And this first season he has picked some great topics to cover: from airport security and charitable donations to summer break, nutrition (one of my fave eps), sex (another fave)to, inevitably, death. Are all the facts presented 100% accurate? Probably not, and Adam even admits that during one of the final episodes, but they do make you think while they amuse and that's important. Too often we take things as fact because they are the status quo, when we should be questioning them. Adam and the show do this for us and it opens up the discussion. Don't accept the way Hollywood or the government present things, do some checking on your own.\n\nThe connecting tissue of Adam tormenting various people by ruining stuff they like or took for granted, is hilarious, or in the final episode, downright scary. The supporting cast is a lot of fun and I hope to see Adam and crew back for a second season. Its been a long time since I've enjoyed a non-fiction TV show this much.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Series Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1266397977", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NjEzNjY3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjEyMjI5NjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NjEzNjY3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjEyMjI5NjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official series trailer for Adam Ruins Everything on truTV.", "uploadDate": "2015-09-30T06:52:05Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5034326", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Adam-Ruins-Everything", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Adam-Ruins-Everything/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Adam-Ruins-Everything/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Adam-Ruins-Everything/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2016-11-24"}
