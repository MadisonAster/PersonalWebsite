It's why I loved Robert Wuhl's Assume the Position specials.\n\nAdam Ruins Everything is all about challenging our misconceptions, like diamonds are valuable and tin foil covers protect our aspirin. It is absolutely fascinating to see how many things we just accept without much thought are pure BS.\n\nBut the series is also really, really funny and engaging. While Penn & Teller or Robert Wuhl basically did a teaching-with-jokes format, Adam creates entire elaborate dramas in which in encounters people enjoying their lives and harasses them with a steady stream of facts while they beg him to stop. The show is incredibly funny, but also very serious about its information, footnoting each fact and bringing on experts in an amusing manner.\n\nAdam also likes to counter the bleakness of a message that often comes down to \"everything you're counting on is a sham\" with information about things that genuinely work. \n\nThis series lasted a whole season before I even knew it existed; I hope people find it as I did, because it's amazing.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "10"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Series Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1266397977", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NjEzNjY3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjEyMjI5NjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NjEzNjY3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjEyMjI5NjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official series trailer for Adam Ruins Everything on truTV.", "uploadDate": "2015-09-30T06:52:05Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5034326", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Adam-Ruins-Everything", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Adam-Ruins-Everything/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Adam-Ruins-Everything/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Adam-Ruins-Everything/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Adam-Ruins-Everything/thumb.jpg"}
