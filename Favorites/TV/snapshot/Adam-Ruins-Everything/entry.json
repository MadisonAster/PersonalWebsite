As if facts had their own agendas...\n\nWhile it's true I've always (somewhat cheekily) suspected reality to have a certain leftist bias, to see rightists argue themselves into logical dead-ends over and over again, while funny in a way, is still alarming.\n\nThis just goes to further proves the importance of shows like Adam Ruins Everything.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Series Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1266397977", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NjEzNjY3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjEyMjI5NjE@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3NjEzNjY3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjEyMjI5NjE@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Official series trailer for Adam Ruins Everything on truTV.", "uploadDate": "2015-09-30T06:52:05Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5034326", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Adam-Ruins-Everything", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Adam-Ruins-Everything/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Adam-Ruins-Everything/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Adam-Ruins-Everything/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Adam-Ruins-Everything/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2016-11-24"}
