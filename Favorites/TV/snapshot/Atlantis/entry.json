JUST ARE NOT GETTING IT.\n\nThis is really a fun parody of Greek Mythology, take Hercules (Mark Addy) who is an overweight womanising drunk who tells heroic stories of his deeds and they are all made up. Does this seriously sound like it should be taken seriously, I mean seriously (yes I used it three times) Mark Addy as Hercules.\n\nCome on people enjoy the show for what it is and not what you expect it to be. To be honest I think the writers have really done a great job of making it such a light entertainment show, with touches of Mythology brought in for you to talk about.\n\nI personally will be watching vividly and hoping the series runs for a few series. 9 out of 10 for taking me into a new world, and wonder what adventures Jason, Pythagoras and Hercules will get up to next.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "9"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Atlantis", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1640348953", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTVhZmM1NmUtNGY4Mi00ZWFiLThmZmUtNzEwNzliNTg4MzRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTVhZmM1NmUtNGY4Mi00ZWFiLThmZmUtNzEwNzliNTg4MzRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Atlantis", "uploadDate": "2019-04-06T09:01:22Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2705602", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Atlantis", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Atlantis/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Atlantis/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Atlantis/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Atlantis/thumb.jpg"}
