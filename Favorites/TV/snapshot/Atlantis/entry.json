Sometimes I come to think they spent all the funds for hiring him so they had nothing for special effects nor sets and locations.\n\nThe mythology in the show is only a loose base of names, sometimes some motives, but if you want to learn about the Greek mythology - then not from here. All the characters are just thrown into one place and time, sometimes they have something in common with the mythology, usually it's only a name. But hey, these are not historic facts, they are myths, so I guess they based an adventure fairytale on other fairy tales, right? Don't get uptight about it, it's not about truth anyway.\n\nThere's a lot of bad reviews here, I can see why, but most of these people haven't given the show a chance. The characters are actually not so idiotic as they seem, there's more to them than just the predictable stereotypes we get at the beginning, but they develop the way they are expected to develop, that's true. But in a world with movies like \"Fast & Furious\", \"Twilight\", countless crime series about good agents and bad terrorists, you really expect every medium budget production to be of great quality?\n\nTo sum it all up, it's definitely not anywhere near \"Game of Thrones\" and such, but it's not so annoyingly stupid as \"Robin Hood\". It's just average, mindless entertainment.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "5"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Atlantis", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi1640348953", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTVhZmM1NmUtNGY4Mi00ZWFiLThmZmUtNzEwNzliNTg4MzRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTVhZmM1NmUtNGY4Mi00ZWFiLThmZmUtNzEwNzliNTg4MzRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Atlantis", "uploadDate": "2019-04-06T09:01:22Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2705602", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Atlantis", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Atlantis/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Atlantis/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Atlantis/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Atlantis/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2013-12-21"}
