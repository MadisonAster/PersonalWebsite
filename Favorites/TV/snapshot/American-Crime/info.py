            'reviewBody': 'I watch a lot of foreign movies and TV series '
                          'because I find most domestic products to be '
                          'formulistic, highly predictable, shallow or '
                          'simplistic (many fine exceptions exist - as '

                          'etc.). This holds particularly true for anything '
                          'offered by the big 4 networks. As an example watch '
                          'both versions of the series " Secrets and Lies" and '
                          'you will clearly see the difference between an off '
                          'shore and a domestic take on the same story. For me '
                          'there is no comparison, the original Aussi version '
                          'is much more to my liking. \n'

                          'Now to "Crime Story"; it takes a couple of episodes '
                          'to develop but like a fine wine after it breathes a '
                          'bit the content becomes richer and more accessible. '
                          'I really appreciate the casting, character '
                          'development is strong and the pace is just right '
                          'for me. All the actors are superb, pretty much '
                          'every cast member gives an honest and compelling '
                          'performance. The camera work is artful, not artsy '
                          'but artful, adding to the experience. It is a drama '
                          'and as such there is very little to feel good about '
                          'here but the story so far is strong, well told and '
                          'deals with serious issues. I eagerly look forward '
                          'to each new episode. My typical viewing habit is to '
                          'record episodes of shows I follow and then watch 2 '
                          'or more at a time. Skipping through commercials, '
                          'especially for dramas, allows the story to flow and '
                          'for emotional or dramatic moments to make their '
