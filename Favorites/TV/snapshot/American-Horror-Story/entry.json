I will be completely honest, the first 2 episodes really turned me off. I figured this season was heading down the same path as Roanoke and perhaps worse with the political and social overtones. HOWEVER, I decided to keep watching. Things have turned around dramatically and I am now engaged in this season. It is ridiculous and unbelievable, but the characters are now starting to show themselves and several secrets are now out in the open. The show has been very good the past 3 episodes and has officially drawn me back in.\n\nI will say this... the 5th episode \"Holes\" is brutal. I've been watching horror for over 30 years and I can honestly say I haven't had a scene un-nerve me to the extent this one did. Watch and you'll see what I mean.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "\"AHS: 1984\" Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3484729113", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTc4NWU3YmEtODc5NC00NGRjLWEyYjUtNTcwMTk0YWQyMTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTc4NWU3YmEtODc5NC00NGRjLWEyYjUtNTcwMTk0YWQyMTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The ninth season of \"American Horror Story\" travels back to 1984 to celebrate slasher genre.", "uploadDate": "2019-08-26T19:19:55Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1844624", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Horror-Story", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Horror-Story/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Horror-Story/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Horror-Story/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
