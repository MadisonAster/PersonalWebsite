Finally something that pushes the boundaries and takes some chances. In a time when everybody worries so much about whats real they unwilling to buy into anything slightly outlandish. Suspend your disbelieve and take a walk into the strangest, most twisted little series I've seen since Carnivale. I love this nightmarish ride into the twilight zone. \n\nI think the casting is superb. Great acting throughout. The writing is fast paced and doesn't stretch things out like many long winded series. Too many shows take for ever to get the ball rolling. This show is fast paced and never leaves you much chance to breath before springing another traumatic event your way. I can hardly wait to see where this fun house ride leads to next."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "\"AHS: 1984\" Official Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi3484729113", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTc4NWU3YmEtODc5NC00NGRjLWEyYjUtNTcwMTk0YWQyMTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTc4NWU3YmEtODc5NC00NGRjLWEyYjUtNTcwMTk0YWQyMTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "The ninth season of \"American Horror Story\" travels back to 1984 to celebrate slasher genre.", "uploadDate": "2019-08-26T19:19:55Z"}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1844624", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Horror-Story", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Horror-Story/info.py", "Entry_php": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Horror-Story/info.php", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Horror-Story/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/American-Horror-Story/thumb.jpg"}
