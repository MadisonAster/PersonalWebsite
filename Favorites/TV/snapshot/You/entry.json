Who on earth? (even with the blatant problems of Joe) would even give this irritating, millennial, pretention the time of day, never mind killing, cheating, obsessing over her, yadayada!!!! ..... Terrible actress and a weak female lead, considering she's supposed to be a 'writer' I feel the irony in her scripts are beyond hilarity. This show only holds up due to Penn Badgley. If it wasn't for his part, this would be entirely unwatchable. I wish more thought could have gone into all of the other vacuous brat pack characters."}, "trailer": {"@type": "VideoObject", "name": "Season 2 Trailer", "embedUrl": "/video/imdb/vi152878873", "thumbnail": {"@type": "ImageObject", "contentUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmM3MzkyNGItZWE0ZC00MzJhLTgxODItYTRhOTFlOTJmYzA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"}, "thumbnailUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmM3MzkyNGItZWE0ZC00MzJhLTgxODItYTRhOTFlOTJmYzA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg", "description": "Meet Will Bettelheim.
