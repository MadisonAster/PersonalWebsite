Humboldt County, California is known for its \"Emerald Triangle\", where most of the illegal cannabis in the U.S.A. used to be grown and has gone through intense upheaval due to the legalization of cannabis in California (everybody wants a piece of the monetary pie). Lurking behind the cannabis industry, legal or illegal, are the sobering statistics regarding the amount of missing people in the region, the number of unsolved murders, and other crime stats this documentary didn't delve into, and a Sheriff's Office that's more intent on the cannabis industry than anything else (they'll say it's because illegal grows are the root of all evil, however, taxation and money appear to have a lot more influence on their actions than the causation of crime). The documentary, also, exposes what happens when a way of life is obliterated in the name of progress.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "8"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9078908", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Murder-Mountain", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Murder-Mountain/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Murder-Mountain/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/Murder-Mountain/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-03-2020"}
