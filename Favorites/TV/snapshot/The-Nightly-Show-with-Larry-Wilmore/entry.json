The problem, I think, is that Larry isn't a great solo act. On the Daily Show, as the \"Senior Black Corespondent,\" he was bouncing off of Stewart. Maybe that's why they decided to do these panel discussions for a good majority of the show, but I've never found it interesting to watch a group of strangers (or near strangers) chat about a subject.\n\nI don't mind that the show is focused on black issues and concerns, and in fact I was ready to find that spin refreshing. His panels are somewhat racially diverse, so I don't feel left out as a white woman ... I'm afraid I just don't think the format is working, and I'm not convinced that Larry has the right force of personality to make this show work.", "reviewRating": {"@type": "Rating", "worstRating": "1", "bestRating": "10", "ratingValue": "4"}}, "EntryURL": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3722332", "EntryPath": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Nightly-Show-with-Larry-Wilmore", "Entry_py": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Nightly-Show-with-Larry-Wilmore/info.py", "Entry_json": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Nightly-Show-with-Larry-Wilmore/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "W:/Portfolio/PersonalWebsite/Favorites/TV/snapshot/The-Nightly-Show-with-Larry-Wilmore/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "2015-01-22"}
