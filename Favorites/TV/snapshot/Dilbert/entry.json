Chris Elliot as Dogbert. Kathy Griffin as Alice. Gordon Hunt as Wally. Larry Miller as the Boss. Jackie Hoffman as Dilmom. Tom Kenny as Ratbert and Ashook. Jim Wise as Loud Howard. Jason Alexander as Catbert. Maurice La Marche as the Trash Man.\n\nThis was one of those gem shows that for some reason only picked up a select cult audience. Because of that it was canceled, even though it was a great show. It was about workaholic Dilbert and his life in his cubicle. His closest friends are Dogbert, his talking pet dog that's smarter than him, Alice and Wally, his buddies from work and the mysterious trashman who always disappears after giving advice. I highly recommend you buy the DVD because this was a great show, and its a shame only 2 seasons were produced.\n\nMy rating: 9 out of 10. 30 episodes.
