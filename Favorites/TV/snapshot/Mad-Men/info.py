                          'ambitious TV shows in some  time. It is worth close '
                          'study, not just for learning how to create a  '
                          'well-structured show but also how to write one that '
                          'is truly original  and potentially groundbreaking.  '
                          'Story world, or arena, is one of the key structural '
                          'elements in any TV  drama (see the TV Drama Class '
                          'for how to create this element, as well  as the '
                          'other essential structural elements of a successful '
                          'show). It is  where the story takes place and it '
                          'usually exists within some specific  arena that not '
                          'only delineates a recognizable unit but also has a '
                          'set  of rules, activities and values that defines '
                          'the characters.  One of the strengths of Mad Men is '
                          'its story world. Instead of the  usual arena of '
                          'cops, lawyers, or doctors, Mad Men takes us into a  '
                          'Manhattan advertising agency in 1960. Besides being '
                          'totally unique in  TV, this story world is '
                          "extremely detailed. And the detailing isn't  simply "
                          'a matter of the set design, which is fabulous. It '
                          'is written  into every episode. The writers weave '
                          'all manner of cultural icons of  the late 50s-early '
                          '60s, including TV shows, ads, and fashion.  This '
                          'has two great advantages. One is the pleasure of '
                          'recognition. If  you were a kid at that time, as I '
                          'was, the show is a virtual time  machine. And even '
                          "if you weren't, the authenticity and texture "
                          'immerse  you in the world and make you feel that '
                          '"You are there!" The other  great advantage is that '
                          'this past world tricks the audience into  believing '
                          'that this is how it really was back then. The first '
                          'thing we  notice when we see all of these details '
                          'is how much the world has  changed. Everybody '
                          'smoked back then. The men were in charge and the  '
                          'women were all secretaries and housewives. That '
                          'sets up the kicker. By  first thinking how much '
                          "we've changed, we then realize, with even more  "
                          "impact, all the ways we haven't. This story, set in "
                          '1960, is really  about today, or more exactly, the '
                          'ways that human nature only puts on a  new skin and '
                          'the same fundamental challenges of creating a '
                          'meaningful  life must be faced by each of us, every '
                          'moment of every day.  Another structural element '
                          'that immediately jumps out at you if you  want to '
                          'create a TV show or write for one is the desire '
                          'line. In Mad  Men the desire that structures each '
                          "episode is fairly nebulous, and  that's probably "
                          "going to cut into the show's popularity (I hope "
                          "I'm  wrong on this one). Desire is the main reason "
                          'almost all TV shows are  set in the cop, lawyer, '
                          'and doctor arenas. These jobs give their shows  a '
                          'simple and repeatable desire line that tracks the '
                          'episode every week.  Catch the criminal. Win the '
                          'case. Save the life. But of course this is  '
                          "extremely limiting. Most people don't spend their "
                          'daily lives solving  crimes, prosecuting bad guys, '
                          'and saving lives.  So while the desire line on this '
                          'show may be more nebulous, it is far  closer to '
                          'what most Americans do in their daily lives. These '
                          'Mad Men  are in the business of selling, which, as '
                          'Arthur Miller pointed out  long ago, is the '
                          "archetypal American action. But they aren't selling "
                          "a  particular product. They're selling desire, some "
                          'image of the good life  that, because it is a '
                          'fabricated ideal, is always just out of reach.  '
                          "Writer Matthew Weiner's brilliant conception for "
                          'this show is to  connect the selling of desire to '
                          'America to the personal and work lives  of the ad '
                          'men themselves. The ad men want the image of the '
                          'good life in  America that they are selling to be '
                          'true, even if they intellectually  make fun of the '
                          'poor suckers out there who buy it. Main character '
                          'Don  Draper is handsome and talented, with a '
                          'beautiful wife and two cute  little kids. But he '
                          "has some secrets he's keeping \x96 like a mistress "
                          'in  the city \x96 and he feels a terrible void he '
                          'has no idea how to shake.  Draper is a master at '
                          'manipulating desire and creating facades, so when  '

                          'life" falls apart in  his hands.  We are in Far '
                          'from Heaven and American Beauty territory here. And '
                          'the  second episode even had Draper give his own '
                          'version of the  Existentialist credo of Sartre and '
                          'Camus that was seeping into pop  culture during the '
