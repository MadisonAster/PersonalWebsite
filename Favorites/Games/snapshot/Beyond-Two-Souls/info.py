 'description': '<p>This game is often called an &quot;interactive film&quot; '
                '- because the proportion between the given story and the '
                'possibilities to influence the story is indeed somewhat '
                'different than in most games. The game develops between three '
                'points in the biography of the girl Jodie Holmes. In these '
                'three points, we find ourselves repeatedly. And in general, '
                'we see 16 years of her life, from 8 to 24 years.<br />\n'
                'Jodie from birth has a gift of communication with a '
                'disembodied being called Aiden. In this context, the '
                'Jodie-Aiden couple can capture people&#39;s consciousness, '
                'move objects, and even strangle people. At the same time, '
                'Jodie is periodically exposed to attacks of vague '
                'energies.<br />\n'
                'Her parents are not her relatives, they give her to '
                'psychiatrists and refuse her. When the family of one of the '
                'psychiatrists perishes, Jodie, with the help of Ayden, '
                'establishes a connection with the deceased, she can let the '
                'living and the dead speak.<br />\n'
                'The CIA is interested in Jodie&#39;s abilities and makes her '
                'become an agent. She then instructs her on several missions, '
                'but Jodie realises that she is being used for criminal '
                'activities - and refuses to cooperate with the CIA. CIA '
                'agents do not leave her alone, and she destroys them.<br />\n'
                'The game has a lot of interpretations of what is happening in '
                'the world of the dead, different people use Jodi&#39;s forces '
                'in different ways. Jody herself also does not have a clear '
                'picture, she seeks and finds real parents, helps different '
                'people - but they rarely pay her the same.</p>',
