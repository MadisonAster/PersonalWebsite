 'description': '<p>The game that started the popular Uncharted series. It is '
                'all about a treasure hunt in the jungle and ancient ruins and '
                'thus somewhat similar in mood and aesthetics to the Tomb '
                'Raider series, albeit with a slightly more realistic '
                'approach. </p>\n'
                '<p>The plot follows the adventurer and treasure seeker Nathan '
                'Drake, who believes himself to be a distant offspring of the '
                'famous Sir Francis Drake. When exhuming his ancestor&#39;s '
                'remains, Nathan discovers an artifact that supposedly shows '
                'him the way to the legendary El Dorado, the city of gold in '
                'the Latin American folklore. Accompanied by journalist Elena '
                'Fisher, he sets out on a dangerous journey to a remote '
                'island. Throughout the game Nathan, controlled by the player, '
                'will have to fight pirates, using both melee weapons and '
                'firearms, and explore ancient ruins by jumping the cliffs, '
                'climbing the walls and swinging from the ropes.</p>\n'
                '<p>Uncharted: Drake&#39;s Fortune includes motion-captured '
                'cinematic cutscenes that help develop characters and the plot '
                'to the point the game may feel like a blockbuster movie.</p>',
