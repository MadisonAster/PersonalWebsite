 'description': '<p>Fallout franchise started in a very different way than we '
                'all know it by this day. As Bethesda started to develop '
                'Fallout franchise only from the third game, original Fallout '
                'was completely different.</p>\n'
                '<p>The game starts in 2161, 84 years after a nuclear war '
                'destroyed most of the planet and turned into Wasteland. You '
                'can either create your protagonist or play as three pre-set '
                'options - Albert Cole, Max Stone or Natalia Dubrovhsky. When '
                'in Vault 13 water supplies start to malfunction via technical '
                'reasons, Overseer sends protagonist in a quest to find a '
                'replacement and save the Vault. Having Pip-Boy and some '
                'standard equipment, the Fallout world is absolutely open for '
                'exploration. </p>\n'
                '<p>Although being a completely different genre of the game, '
                'Fallout still uses the same systems as we know today. '
                'S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system of characters stats (strength, '
                'perception, endurance, charisma, intelligence, agility and '
                'luck) affect your skills in a variety from 0% to 200%, as '
                'well as definitive straits that you choose only once for '
                'whole gameplay. Known to players as Karma, you can choose how '
                'to act in most of the situations and determine your '
                'reputation with other characters in the game.</p>',
