 'description': '<p>The creator of the game often travelled through Asia and '
                'made the observation that the work of an immigration officer '
                'checking documents for entry is simultaneously very '
                'monotonous and very responsible. The game reproduces this '
                'work - but scammers and unusual situations occur in it much '
                'more often than in reality. The task of the player-officer is '
                'not to make a mistake, not to let an unwanted guest into the '
                'country. He has power, directories, translucent devices, '
                'etc., but experienced masters of deception and fraud act '
                'against him. The task of the player is complicated by the '
                'fact that his country is like all the paranoid dictatorships '
                'at the same time. This country fears a lot, seeks to control '
                'everything and periodically generates various rules. The game '
                'has a lot of humour, a lot of exciting puzzles and unexpected '
                'twists, including shooting. The visual and musical design of '
                'the game reflects the bizarre world of stupid rules, constant '
                'fear and mutual distrust.</p>',
