 'description': '<p>Oddworld: Abe’s Oddysee is the first chapter of the '
                'Oddworld franchise. The game is set in the fictional Oddworld '
                'universe inhabited by extraterrestrials. The story follows '
                'Abe, a slave on the Mudokon meat factory, who suddenly '
                'realizes the perspective of being slaughtered in the near '
                'future with all of his fellow slaves. Players are offered to '
                'take control of Abe on his way to the liberation of the rest '
                'of enslaved Mudokons. The gameplay features classic '
                'platformers’ mechanics: all the action is divided into 2D '
                'levels that should be passed. In the course of the '
                'completion, Abe is going to solve puzzles, overcome obstacles '
                'and defeat (or dodge) enemies. Each players’ mistake from '
                'failing a grenade throw to falling from high ground will '
                'cause death and a restart of the level from the last '
                'checkpoint, which means difficulties. On the way through the '
                'Oddworld Abe can use his supernatural ability to '
                'telepathically influence Sligs (unplayable characters). '
                'However, their help is only available in safe areas, so the '
                'Mudokons’ rescue is though up to Abe.</p>',
