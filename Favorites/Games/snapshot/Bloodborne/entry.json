{"name": "Bloodborne", "slug": "bloodborne", "EntryURL": "https://rawg.io/games/bloodborne", "description": "<p>Bloodborne is an action-RPG and another member of souls-like title series. The game has no predecessors or successors, making it the only entry with one add-on: \u201cThe Old Hunters.\u201d The Bloodborne universe, however, also includes a comics and a board game.</p>\n<p>Generally resembling the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, however, has some different mechanics and the pace of combat is increased thanks to the risk-rewarding battle system. Another difference is multiplayer, which comes in two kinds: you can summon other players into your game and fight bosses side by side or you can fight impostors, who are other players invading your playthrough.</p>\n<p>Throughout the game, you are forced to explore an enormous open world of Yharnam, which looks like alternate universe Lovecraft-inspired Victorian-era England, as The Hunter. You meet horrific bosses, explore vast areas, houses and open spaces while continually dodging, attacking and trying not to get killed by a massive number of hostile NPCs.</p>", "added": 5463, "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/214/214b29aeff13a0ae6a70fc4426e85991.jpg", "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "platforms": ["PlayStation 4"], "developers": ["FromSoftware", "Sony Interactive Entertainment"], "publishers": [], "released": "2015-03-24", "EntryPath": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Bloodborne", "Entry_py": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Bloodborne/info.py", "Entry_json": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Bloodborne/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Bloodborne/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "08-01-2020"}
