 'description': '<p>Bloodborne is an action-RPG and another member of '
                'souls-like title series. The game has no predecessors or '
                'successors, making it the only entry with one add-on: “The '
                'Old Hunters.” The Bloodborne universe, however, also includes '
                'a comics and a board game.</p>\n'
                '<p>Generally resembling the Dark Souls series, Bloodborne, '
                'however, has some different mechanics and the pace of combat '
                'is increased thanks to the risk-rewarding battle system. '
                'Another difference is multiplayer, which comes in two kinds: '
                'you can summon other players into your game and fight bosses '
                'side by side or you can fight impostors, who are other '
                'players invading your playthrough.</p>\n'
                '<p>Throughout the game, you are forced to explore an enormous '
                'open world of Yharnam, which looks like alternate universe '
                'Lovecraft-inspired Victorian-era England, as The Hunter. You '
                'meet horrific bosses, explore vast areas, houses and open '
                'spaces while continually dodging, attacking and trying not to '
                'get killed by a massive number of hostile NPCs.</p>',
