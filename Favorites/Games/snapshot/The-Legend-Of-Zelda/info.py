 'description': '<p>Ganon, the King of Evil, has broken free of the Dark World '
                'and has captured Hyrule&#39;s beloved Princess Zelda. But, '
                'before she was caught, Zelda managed to shatter the Triforce '
                'of Wisdom and scatter its eight pieces throughout Hyrule. You '
                'begin your adventure by finding a small wooden sword in a '
                'dark cave. Then, as you grow in stature, experience, and '
                'strength, so do your weapons. Help Link collect the captured '
                'pieces of the Triforce, rescue the princess, and thwart '
                'Ganonâ€™s evil plans!</p>\n'
                '<p>The epic series The Legend of Zelda began here, with the '
                'heroic Link on a hazardous journey through the fantastic '
                'world of Hyrule. Using your sword, your shield and your wits, '
                'retrieve the eight fragments of the Triforce and save '
                'Princess Zelda.</p>\n'
                '<p>This groundbreaking game introduced innovative ideas that '
                'are still present in Zelda games more than 25 years later. '
                'Not only is Link&#39;s original adventure action-packed, it '
                'also features puzzling dungeons to explore and a myriad of '
                'secrets to discover.</p>',
