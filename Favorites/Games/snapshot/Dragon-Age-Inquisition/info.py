 'description': '<p>You have to revive and lead the Inquisition, which aims to '
                'eradicate evil in the land of Thedas. War, intrigue, '
                'political strife deprived previously influential groups of '
                'Thedas the opportunity to act with the same efficiency. '
                'Players will have to respond to this threat, as well as '
                'explore a vast world, meet old and new characters and gather '
                'strength for the growing Inquisition.</p>\n'
                '<p>You play as an inquisitor, and you can choose for your '
                'character: gender, race, voice, name and customise his look. '
                'Depending on the selected race, the player will receive '
                'specific bonuses and will be offered a choice of three '
                'classes: rogue, mage and warrior.</p>\n'
                '<p>As in the previous parts of the series, the player '
                'controls not only his character but also a detachment of '
                'companions collected by him. In total, the game features nine '
                'companions. In battle, the player, as before, can activate a '
                'pause, during which the game stops, and at this time you can '
                'give orders to teammates. Everything is built on the '
                'dialogues between the characters, and they can directly '
                'change the ending of the game.</p>',
