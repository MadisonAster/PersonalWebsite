 'description': '<p>Mirror&#39;s Edge Catalyst is the second part in the '
                'Mirror&#39;s Edge series. Like its predecessor, it is based '
                'around parkour simulation.</p>\n'
                '<h3>Plot</h3>\n'
                '<p>The game is set in the near future that is depicted as a '
                'cyberpunk dystopia. The story takes place in the city of '
                'Glass that is ruled by mega-corporations. Faith, the '
                'protagonist of the original game, returns in Catalyst. She is '
                'a Runner, a person who specializes in illegal delivery. Early '
                'in the game, Faith steals a valuable hard drive from a '
                'corporation. After reading its data, she learns about the '
                'Reflection project that will allow the corporations to '
                'control every resident in Glass.</p>\n'
                '<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n'
                '<p>The game combines platforming, parkour, and puzzles in the '
                'vein of Portal series. The player controls Faith from the '
                'first person view as she runs and leaps across the rooftops '
                'of Glass. Puzzle-like level design requires her to use pipes, '
                'wires, and ledges to get to her destination. Precision timing '
                'is important to perform jumps, slides, and rushes in a '
                'seamless flow.</p>\n'
                '<p>The combat system in Catalyst changed dramatically. Unlike '
                'in the original game, Faith cannot use guns. She can fight in '
                'hand-to-hand combat but usually has to avoid enemies.</p>\n'
                '<h3>Style</h3>\n'
                '<p>Like its predecessor, Catalyst is notable for its '
                'minimalist use of colors. Glass is mostly shining white and '
                'dark blue, while the occasional use of other colors signifies '
                'something important. The game is accompanied by the cold, '
                'atmospheric electronic soundtrack by Solar Fields.</p>',
