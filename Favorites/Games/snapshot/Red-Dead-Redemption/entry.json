{"name": "Red Dead Redemption", "slug": "red-dead-redemption", "EntryURL": "https://rawg.io/games/red-dead-redemption", "description": "<p>Red Dead Redemption is a third-person open-world adventure game which implements the Wild West at its best: it is very much GTA-clone but in bizarre stylistics and the very beginning of the twentieth century. This is the second title of a franchise, being preceded by Red Dead Revolver and followed by Red Dead Redemption 2 coming out in late 2018. <br />\nWe play as John Marston who gradually takes down and take out criminals and those, who crosses his path. Among the combat mechanics, the most interesting one is &quot;Dead Eye&quot; \u2014 it allows one to point multiple targets out in slow motion and then shoot them simultaneously. <br />\nThe game features 16-players multiplayer and cooperative and also has zombie DLC \u2014 Undead Nightmare. Additional content adds two modes to the original game: undead overrun in which you have to survive an infinite amount of zombie waves, and Land Grab in which player has to defend the particular piece of land to gain control of it.</p>", "added": 4780, "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/686/686909717c3aa01518bc42ae2bf4259e.jpg", "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "platforms": ["PlayStation 3", "Xbox 360"], "developers": ["Rockstar Games", "Rockstar North", "Rockstar San Diego"], "publishers": ["Rockstar Games"], "released": "2010-05-18", "EntryPath": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Red-Dead-Redemption", "Entry_py": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Red-Dead-Redemption/info.py", "Entry_json": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Red-Dead-Redemption/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Red-Dead-Redemption/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "08-01-2020"}
