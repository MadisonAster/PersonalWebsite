 'description': '<p>Red Dead Redemption is a third-person open-world adventure '
                'game which implements the Wild West at its best: it is very '
                'much GTA-clone but in bizarre stylistics and the very '
                'beginning of the twentieth century. This is the second title '
                'of a franchise, being preceded by Red Dead Revolver and '
                'followed by Red Dead Redemption 2 coming out in late 2018. '
                '<br />\n'
                'We play as John Marston who gradually takes down and take out '
                'criminals and those, who crosses his path. Among the combat '
                'mechanics, the most interesting one is &quot;Dead Eye&quot; — '
                'it allows one to point multiple targets out in slow motion '
                'and then shoot them simultaneously. <br />\n'
                'The game features 16-players multiplayer and cooperative and '
                'also has zombie DLC — Undead Nightmare. Additional content '
                'adds two modes to the original game: undead overrun in which '
                'you have to survive an infinite amount of zombie waves, and '
                'Land Grab in which player has to defend the particular piece '
                'of land to gain control of it.</p>',
