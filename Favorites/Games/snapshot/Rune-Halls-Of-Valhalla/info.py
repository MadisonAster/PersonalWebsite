 'description': '<p>It was foretold that during Ragnarok, the gods would fall '
                'and the nine realms would be consumed by frost and fire… but '
                'it is not what happened. The gods did not perish. Instead, '
                'for seven terrible years, giants, beasts, and the undead have '
                'ravaged the realms while the gods inexplicably withheld their '
                'protection. Immersed in darkness and chaos, mankind’s own '
                'world of Midgard lies captive in the cruel grasp of maniacal '
                'Loki.<br />\n'
                'As a hardened Viking warrior, Rune players will align with '
                'their chosen god as they pillage villages for powerful '

                'receive blessings of strength and magic.  Your quest is '
                'simple – destroy Loki, but you needn’t do it alone. Team up '
                'with your Viking allies to gain the benefits of shared '
                'experience and the strength that only comes in numbers.<br '
