 'description': "<p>Conker's Bad Fur Day is a platformer video game developed "
                'by Rare and released for the Nintendo 64 video game console '
                'in 2001. As part of the Conker video game series, the game '
                'follows the story of Conker the Squirrel, a greedy, '
                'heavy-drinking red squirrel who attempts to return home to '
                'his girlfriend Berri. The gameplay is composed of various '
                'challenges that involve platforming, solving puzzles, '
                'fighting enemies, and gathering objects. The game also '
                'features a multiplayer mode where a maximum of four players '
                'can compete in seven different game types.</p>\n'
                "<p>Although visually similar to Rare's family-oriented "
                'Nintendo 64 platform games Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, '
                "Conker's Bad Fur Day was designed for mature audiences and "
                'features graphic violence, alcohol and tobacco use, '
                'profanity, vulgar humor and pop culture references. It was '
                'developed over the course of four years and was originally '
                'intended for a family audience, but was ultimately retooled '
                'into its current form because previews were criticised for '
                "being both too cute and similar to Rare's earlier platform "
                'games.</p>\n'
                "<p>Upon release, Conker's Bad Fur Day received critical "
                'acclaim from video game journalists, who praised its visual '
                'appeal and smart, funny humour. The game sold well below '
                'expectations due to limited advertising and a release towards '
                "the end of the Nintendo 64's life cycle, but has since earned "
                'a cult following due to its unique styling. A remake, Conker: '
                'Live &amp; Reloaded, was released for the Xbox in 2005. In '
                '2015, the game was included as part of the Rare Replay '
                'compilation for Xbox One.</p>',
