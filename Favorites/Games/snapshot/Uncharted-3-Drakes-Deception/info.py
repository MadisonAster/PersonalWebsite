                'series. Game played from a third-person perspective, with the '
                'player in control of Nathan &quot;Nate&quot; Drake. This is a '
                'person passionately carried away by historical riddles, '
                'promising a reward in the form of hidden treasures.<br />\n'
                'Drake can run with acceleration, make jumps, swim, climb up. '
                'Sometimes he demonstrates something completely acrobatic. For '
                'confrontation with opponents, he uses the art of hand-to-hand '
                'combat with a variety of attacks, including a battle with '
                'several opponents simultaneously. He also has a surprise '
                'concerning dealing with firearms. Weapons and ammunition he '
                'picks up from the defeated opponents.<br />\n'
                'From time to time, further movement in the game requires the '
                'hero to find solutions to puzzles, using his diary and the '
                'hints of the game itself.<br />\n'
                'Nathan with his mentor Victor Sullivan travels in search of '
                'the lost city. List of locations includes the streets of '
                'London, cities and deserts on the Middle East, a ch√¢teau in '
