 'description': '<h3>Story and the setting</h3>\n'
                '<p>The second part of the well-known series of games in the '
                'genre of hit and run. Rockstar games have always had a '
                'well-developed world and history, but this trend did not '
                'affect the first two parts of the GTA. The plot in them is '
                'just a cosmetic and reason to cause mayhem on the streets - a '
                'set of missions from different gangs. Also in the first two '
                'parts of the game, the developers used a top-down '
                'perspective. The game was remembered by the intro video. It '
                'is referred to simply as GTA 2: The Movie. In an eight-minute '
                'masterpiece, a chase rushes after an unnamed man. As a '
                'result, a bag full of drugs belonging to one of the gangs '
                'ends up in his hands. The Mafia sends the killer to chase '
                'him.</p>\n'
                '<h3>Key Features</h3>\n'
                '<p>The player has to fulfill the missions that he receives in '
                'payphones and earn the location of gambling gangs. The game '
                'takes place in a retro-futuristic megapolis, which is called '
                'on the game&#39;s website and in the manual nothing else but '
                '“Anywhere, USA.” The city is divided into three levels: '
                'Downtown, the Residential District and the Industrial '
                'District. Each is dominated by a certain gang. They are all '
                'rivals, but have something in common: they oppose the '
                'Zaibatsu corporation. The game improved the saving mechanics: '
                'now you need to save $ 50,000 and find a church. The last '
                'task is still complicated: there is no map in the game.</p>',
