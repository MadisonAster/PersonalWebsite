 'description': '<p>South Park: The Stick of Truth is an action RPG based on '
                'the American animated series South Park. Players assume the '
                'role of the New Kid, who moved to eponymous fictional town in '
                'Colorado State with his parents. According to the storyline, '
                'the New Kid meets the army of humans led by Wizard King '
                'Cartman in the Kupa Keep Kingdom (Cartman’s backyard) and '
                'gets his nickname Douchebag. Cartman, as well as other '
                'characters of the original series, introduce The Stick of '
                'Truth, the key to the war between humans and elves, to the '
                'New Kid. Once The Stick is stolen by elves, the war and the '
                'whole adventure of Douchebag begins. The game is viewed from '
                'the third-person perspective. To start the campaign, players '
                'have to choose one of the character types (Fighter, Thief, '
                'Mage, and Jew), each with its own parameters and special '
                'abilities. Completing the levels and eliminating the enemies '
                'gives experience points that could be spent on learning new '
                'skills or upgrading the level. The gameplay also features '
                'fast travel ability. Remarkable characters of the original '
                'series – Cartman, Butters, Stan, and Kyle – join the '
                'protagonist during his wild adventure.</p>',
