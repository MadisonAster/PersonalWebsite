 'description': '<p>FICSIT - AN INTRODUCTION<br />\n'
                'Welcome to FICSIT Incorporated! A company specialised in the '
                'research, development and application of new technology and '
                'science, anything to find short-term solutions to long-term '
                'problems! As part of our brand-new Save The Day program, '
                'you’ll be sent to one of many alien planets in an effort to '
                'contribute to Project Assembly, a project I am legally bound '
                'to not tell you anything about for fear of our lives. And my '
                'job.<br />\n'
                'As an engineer and pioneer, you won’t only be constructing '
                'and automating the very factory that will contribute to '
                'Project Assembly, but also explore and exploit the planet and '
                'its inhabitants as you expand. Don’t worry, we’re super '
                'inclusive when it comes to alien lifeforms! We’ll even allow '
                'for pets, how cool is that!?<br />\n'
                'Just don’t tell R&amp;D.<br />\n'
                'Below you can find the three main pillars of your mission! '
                'Time to get to work, and Stay Effective!<em><br />\n'
                '</em>This motto is FICSIT Inc. property. Please do not use '
                'ironically.<br />\n'
                'CONSTRUCT<br />\n'
                'To achieve company milestones according to satisfaction we '
                'expect you to construct your FICSIT Inc. factory in such a '
                'way that it allows for easy expansion and complexion. Not '
                'only will buildings grow more complex over time, so will the '
                'parts they produce. Project Assembly isn’t your average '
                'high-school science project. We’re making history here! Go '
                'big or go home!<em> Of course, this requires both high-level '
                'and low-level power management, good luck getting to nuclear! '
                'We even support stuff like multi-floor warehouses so you can '
                'stack your buildings, and a whole bunch of navigational '
                'constructs like jump pads and walkways! Walkways are the '
                'best. They’re attached to the ground and everything.<br />\n'
                '</em>Employee will be expected to fund their own travel '
                'expenses<br />\n'
                'AUTOMATE<br />\n'
                'So you know how your FICSIT Inc. factory can be turned into '
                'this incredibly intricate maze of conveyor belts in every '
                'direction, merging, splitting, crossing each other above and '
                'below? Conveyor belts carry, after all, the life-blood of our '
                'company! Well, since you’ll be in a pretty big area you’re '
                'going to need outposts. To make your life easier, we’ve '
                'developed self-driving trucks and trains so you can set up '
                'your very own transport system between any point in your '
                'area!<br />\n'
                'EXPLORE &amp; EXPLOIT<br />\n'
                'R&amp;D hasn’t figured out how to clone materials yet, '
                'weirdly enough, so you’re going to have to go out and use our '
                'patented method of extraterrestrial pioneering! This means '
                'exploring to find more or new stuff to exploit, to help '
                'expand your FICSIT Inc. factory. You’re on an uncharted alien '
                'planet, so try to be careful, don’t go alone if you don’t '
                'have to, and use protection! Who knows what kind of organisms '
                'have made this place their home? Or who knows what awesome '
                'treasures you’ll find? Don’t worry, this is why we assigned '
                'you your very own FICSIT Inc. handler.</p>',
