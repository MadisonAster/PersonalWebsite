 'description': '<p>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an action game with '
                'platforming and puzzle solving elements. You take on the role '
                'of the Prince who gets two powerful artifacts: the Dagger of '
                'Time and the Sands of Time. Tricked by the Vizier, he '
                'releases the Sands that turn citizens into monsters. Now '
                'Prince needs to fix his mistake.</p>\n'
                '<p>The key feature of the game is Prince’s ability to rewind '
                'time using the Dagger. It’s combined with platforming as you '
                'explore the city climbing walls and jumping over obstacles, '
                'and fights with enemies. If you make a mistake during these '
                'activities, you can go back to ten seconds and change your '
                'actions. The Dagger also allows to slow time and freeze '
                'enemies. You can’t customize the protagonist, however, you '
                'can upgrade his health and power at special points within '
                'levels. <br />\n'
                'The game consists of several levels full of multiple traps '
                'and environmental puzzles. Some levels are cooperative and '
                'you complete them together with your AI companion, Farah. '
                'While Prince uses melee combat and different tricks, she '
                'fires a bow at enemies. You need to protect Farah because the '
                'game ends if she dies..</p>',
