 'description': 'The Witcher is the very first instalment of the series that '
                'follows the story of Geralt from Rivia. Being found '
                'unconscious on the battlefield he must retrieve his memory '
                "and help the emperor's daughter, Adda to stop her from "
                'turning in to a feral monster. Facing the biggest enemy, '
                'Salamander, Geralt must also help all the fractions around '
                'the world to find peace between each other.\r\n'
                '\r\n'
                'The fighting system is very flexible. Choosing from three '
                'different styles, you can adapt Geralt for any kind of a '
                'combat situation. Fast style of fighting gives you an '
                'opportunity to strike your opponents with your speed. The '
                'strong style focuses itself on destroying your enemies with '
                'powerful attacks, while sweeping style is very good when '
                'facing a number of foes. You can also craft some potions to '
                'gain important benefits such as seeing in the dark or having '
                'a larger amount HP. Plot style is unique as well. The game '
                'never gives a precise definition of evil, which leads the '
                'player to convenient situations where the choice is quite bad '
                'anyway.',
