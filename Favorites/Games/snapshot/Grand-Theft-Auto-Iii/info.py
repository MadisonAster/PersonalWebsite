 'description': '<p>Grand Theft Auto III is an open-world action game, a part '
                'of the criminal franchise GTA. As the first in the series 3D '
                'game with high-quality textures, GTA III became exemplary in '
                'its genre. </p>\n'
                '<p>The action is located in fictional Liberty City. Its map '
                'is divided into three parts – each becomes available '
                'gradually, depending on the storyline progress. The player '
                'takes control of the character from the third-person view. '
                '</p>\n'
                '<p>The classic feature of GTA III is the ability to interact '
                'with the world: explore the map either on foot or by car, '
                'contact with other characters, visit weapon stores and shoot '
                'everywhere. Although GTA III is another chapter of the '
                'franchise, its plot is unique. </p>\n'
                '<p>The story begins with the dynamic bank robbery. During the '
                'heist scene, the main character (silent and unnamed for the '
                'whole game) gets betrayed by his accomplice Catalina. By good '
                'fortune, the protagonist escapes from imprisonment and starts '
                'making both ends meet in Liberty City after being deceived. '
                'Therefore, his only wish – also the main idea of the '
                'storyline – to take the revenge on the former partner.</p>',
