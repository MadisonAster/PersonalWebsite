 'description': '<p>Final Fantasy VIII is a Japanese role-playing game, the '
                'eight main installments in Final Fantasy series.  </p>\n'
                '<h3>Plot and setting</h3>\n'
                '<p>Like most other Final Fantasy entries, the game takes '
                'place in an entirely new world that is not connected with '
                'previous games in the series. It can be described as the mix '
                'of modern Europe and futuristic setting with high fantasy '
                'influences. The game follows six main heroes, five of which '
                'are members of the elite military organization called SeeD, '
                'on their quest to defeat Ultimecia, an evil sorceress who '
                'wishes to compress time. Like its predecessor, Final Fantasy '
                'VII, the game heavily focuses on its story, characters and '
                'game world exposure.  </p>\n'
                '<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n'
                '<p>The gameplay of Final Fantasy VIII shares many '
                'similarities with other JRPGs of that era. The player can '
                'explore the overworld, visit different locations such as '
                'town, settlements, forests, interact with NPCs and fight '
                'numerous types of monsters in turn-based battles.<br />\n'
                'While the world exploration aspect, for the most part, is '
                'similar to that of the previous game, the battle system has '
                'several notable differences. The combat in the game is '
                'centered on Junction system that allows the player to '
                'junction summoned monsters known as Guardian Forces to platy '
                'members. That gives characters the ability to use various '
                'magic, alter their stats and draw spells from enemies during '
                'the battles. Because of the systemâ€™s flexibility regarding '
                'character customization, the game is absent of job system '
                'typical for the series.</p>',
