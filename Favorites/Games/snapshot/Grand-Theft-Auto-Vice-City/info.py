 'description': '<p>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City is a third-person shooter with '
                'an open world. The game is set in a fictional city during the '
                '1980’s and exhibits a unique design of locations, people, and '
                'objects, resembling the real world’s counterparts of Vice '
                'City, mainly Miami, FL. GTA: Vice City is a fourth game of '
                'the series, following Grand Theft Auto III.</p>\n'
                '<p>The main character is introduced as Tommy Vercetti, an '
                'Italian-American mobster who works for a wealthy crime '
                'family. Throughout the story, the player will observe as the '
                'protagonist rises the ranks, sometimes making decisions of '
                'questionable nobility or profit. Our goal as a player is to '
                'ensure that Vercetti becomes the boss of all of Vice City’s '
                'mafia, and various story characters will help us or prevent '
                'us from achieving this goal.</p>\n'
                '<p>The worlds of Grand Theft Auto series have long been '
                'worked upon and have been done in much detail, and Vice City '
                'is no different. The people on the sidewalks, the stylish '
                'cars and neon light clubs, the sky-high buildings and lively '
                'piers and beaches, everything will bring nostalgic feelings '
                'to those of players, whose eyes have seen the glory of this '
                'time. The gameplay, however, bears little difference from its '
                'predecessor, continuing the trend of big guns, explosions, '
                'and cop chases.</p>',
