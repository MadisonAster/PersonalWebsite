{"name": "DOOM II", "slug": "doom-ii", "EntryURL": "https://rawg.io/games/doom-ii", "description": "<p>The game from the legendary programmers John Carmack and John Romero, who worked together with American McGee, on the first-person shooter game that will run on anything: from mobile devices to engineering calculators. The game became the second in the series Doom, received improved multiplayer, graphics and improved optimization.</p>\n<p>Gameplay-wise game is not so different from its predecessor. The developers decided to take advantage of the progress of the computer hardware to fine-tune their game engine. The player still took control of the nameless space marine, which traveled through 30 non-linear levels. A level is considered to be completed after the player finds the coded doors. A rich arsenal of weapons and a variety of models of enemies will not get bored.</p>\n<p>The plot continues the story of the first part: after defeating the invasion of demons on the moons of Mars and returning from Hell, the protagonist finds the Earth captured by the creatures that he just conquered. A solo company can be fashioned alone, and in multiplayer, to battle with friends today: for the game, there is a huge amount of third-party mods to play online without using of archaic dial-up connection.</p>", "added": 1582, "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/38a/38af969459ad6e5de116ec8a4a84218c.jpg", "genres": ["Action", "Shooter"], "platforms": ["PC", "PlayStation 4", "Nintendo Switch", "iOS", "macOS", "Xbox 360", "Classic Macintosh", "Game Boy Advance"], "developers": ["Bethesda Softworks", "id Software"], "publishers": ["Bethesda Softworks", "id Software", "Valve", "Activision Blizzard", "GT Interactive Software", "Virgin Interactive"], "released": "1994-09-30", "EntryPath": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Doom-Ii", "Entry_py": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Doom-Ii/info.py", "Entry_json": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Doom-Ii/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Doom-Ii/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-05-2020"}
