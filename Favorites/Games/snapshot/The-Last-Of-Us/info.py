 'description': '<p>The population of the Earth almost disappeared as a result '
                'of a pandemic caused by a mutated fungus. The disease causes '
                'irreversible changes in the human body, a person loses his '
                'mind and behaves aggressively, like a zombie. Civilization no '
                'longer exists, few survivors live in isolation under the '
                'protection of the military.<br />\n'
                'Cities outside the zones are dangerous ruins inhabited by '
                'infected people and people who have almost lost humanity.<br '
                '/>\n'
                'Heroes, the smuggler Joel and teenage girl Ellie, are trying '
                'to cross the continent, colliding in depopulated cities with '
                'all the set of dangers. The game requires hidden actions, the '
                'combat capability and the number of ammunition of the heroes '
                'are small, and it is best for them to avoid fighting. For '
                'most of the game, the player controls Joel, while Ellie and '
                'Joel&#39;s other companions are controlled by artificial '
                'intelligence.<br />\n'
                'The levels of the game are very extensive, at each level the '
                'task is the same - to reach a certain point alive.</p>\n'
                '<p>Characters have something like a shotgun pistol, bow and '
                'arrow, as well as improvised items - pipes, sticks, baseball '
                'bats.<br />\n'

                'perceptiveness.<br />\n'
                'Artificial intelligence, which controls opponents, can behave '
                'differently depending on the situation.</p>',
