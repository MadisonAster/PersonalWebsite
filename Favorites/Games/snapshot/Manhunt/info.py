 'description': '<p>Manhunt is a third-person stealth-action game developed by '
                'Rockstar Games. The game caused a lot of controversy for its '
                'violent scenes.</p>\n'
                '<h3>Plot</h3>\n'
                '<p>A death sentenced convict James awakens in Carcer City '
                'after his supposed execution by lethal injection. The '
                'protagonist finds himself equipped with an earpiece, in which '
                'he hears the voice of The Director. The Director offers James '
                'freedom in turn for helping The Director shoot his violent TV '
                'show. It is said that a gang called The Hoods is patrolling '
                'the neighborhood killing everyone they spot. James has to '
                'survive the night in Carcer City in order to get his '
                'freedom.</p>\n'
                '<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n'
                '<p>The players have to traverse multiple locations to '
                'complete a specific list of tasks. These tasks come down to '
                'getting somewhere, murdering a gang member, and finding '
                'items. </p>\n'
                '<p>There is a group of special enemies called The Hunters '
                'which run to the players as soon as they are spotted. The '
                'game features an advanced stealth system. The players can be '
                'hidden in the shadows, yet if they step on something, a noise '
                'will be made, which can attract The Hunters.</p>\n'
                '<p>There are two ways of executing an enemy - a direct '
                'confrontation or a stealth kill. It is much harder to kill an '
                'enemy using the first way, as the game encourages the players '
                'to use stealth kills. These stealth kills are often referred '
                'to as Executions. There are three types of executions, with '
                'each one varying in their speed and violence.</p>',
