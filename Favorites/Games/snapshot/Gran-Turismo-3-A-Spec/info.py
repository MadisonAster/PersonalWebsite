 'description': '<p>Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec (グランツーリスモ3: A-spec Guran Tsūrisumo '
                'Surī A-supekku) is a 2001 racing game, the first in the Gran '
                'Turismo series released for the PlayStation 2.</p>\n'
                '<p>The objective of the game is to win all the provided '
                'races, championships, complete license tests and achieve 100% '
                'game completion. Every 25% of the game completed results in '
                'the player being awarded a car as a special prize. For GT3, '
                'the Gran Turismo Mode (Simulation Mode in the North American '
                'version) has a reorganized layout, with a more structured and '
                'progressive arrangement of races and challenges. Races vary '
                'from short beginner events to multi-hour endurance races and '
                'also rallying events against an opponent. In addition, the '
                'car shops are now organized by country and then by '
                'manufacturer, which some find to be more intuitive than the '
                'East/West City method used in its predecessor.</p>\n'
                '<p>The Arcade Mode is reorganized in &quot;stages&quot;; '
                'these stages are made up of 5 or 6 tracks pooled from all '
                'available tracks in the game, including both road and rally '
                'races. To get to the next stage, all tracks on a stage must '
                'be completed on Easy difficulty or higher. By beating the '
                'stage on Normal or Difficult, additional cars are unlocked as '
                'well for play in any mode of Arcade Mode (including '
                'two-player battle and time trial).</p>\n'
                '<p>GT3 features 19 race courses, 14 of which have reverse '
                'variants&#39; and 4 of which are dirt tracks. Most of these '
                'circuits are at fictional locations, but California&#39;s '
                'Laguna Seca Raceway and Côte d’Azur (which is heavily based '
                'on the Monaco Grand Prix circuit) are not.</p>\n'
                '<p>Other changes include the omission of the ability to '
                '&quot;race modify&quot; or add downforce to production cars, '
                'removal of suspension damage, and the absence of torque '
                'limits for races.</p>\n'
                '<p>New to the franchise, GT3 also contained unlicensed '
                'versions of six actual Formula One cars, labelled as F686/M, '
                'F687/S, F688/S, F090/S, F094/H and F094/S (in the Japanese '
                'and American versions) that the player could win from '
                'endurance races. In the Japanese and American versions, the '
                'name of each car denotes various pieces of information (such '
                'as the amount of cylinders in the engine, the year the '
                'chassis was raced, and its driver, respectively). For '
                'example, the a forementioned F094/S was the 10-cylinder, '
                '1994-season car driven by Ayrton Senna, whereas the F686/M '
                'represented the 6-cylinder, 1986-season car driven by Nigel '
                'Mansell. In the PAL release, however, there were only two F1 '
                'cars, not obviously based on any real-life counterparts and '
                'instead labelled as Polyphony 001 and 002 respectively.</p>\n'
                '<p>GT3 also marks informal appearances of automakers '
                'Lamborghini and Porsche. A racing JGTC Lamborghini Diablo was '
                'featured in the NTSC-J version (where the car has been cut '
                'from NTSC-U copy and being available in NTSC-U copy with a '
                'cheat device), and a Porsche 911 GT3 can be found in the game '
                'code (though it cannot be obtained normally, and requires the '
                'use of a cheat device). Both cars, together with two hidden '
                'Lancia Stratoses (road and rally versions), however, are '
                'completely absent in PAL version. Lamborghini would make its '
                'first official appearance in 2009&#39;s Gran Turismo (PSP), '
                'while Porsche made its first official appearance in Gran '
                'Turismo Sport for the PlayStation 4.</p>',
