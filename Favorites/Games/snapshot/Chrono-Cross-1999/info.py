                'Chrono Trigger, which was released in 1995 for the Super '
                'Nintendo Entertainment System. Chrono Cross was designed '
                'primarily by scenarist and director Masato Kato, who had help '
                'from other designers who also worked on Chrono Trigger, '

                'The story of Chrono Cross focuses on a teenage boy named '
                'Serge and a theme of parallel worlds. Faced with an alternate '
                'reality in which he died as a child, Serge endeavors to '
                'discover the truth of the two worlds&#39; divergence. The '
                'flashy thief Kid and many other characters assist him in his '

                'working to apprehend him.<br />\n'
                'Upon its release in Japan in 1999 and North America in 2000, '
                'Chrono Cross received critical acclaim, earning a perfect '
                '10.0 score from GameSpot. The game shipped over 1.5 million '
                'copies worldwide, leading to a Greatest Hits re-release and '
