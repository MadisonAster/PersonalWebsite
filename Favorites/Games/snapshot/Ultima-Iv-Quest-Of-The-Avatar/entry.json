It is the first in the \"Age of Enlightenment\" trilogy, shifting the series from the hack and slash, dungeon crawl gameplay of its \"Age of Darkness\" predecessors towards an ethically-nuanced, story-driven approach. Ultima IV has a much larger game world than its predecessors, with an over world map sixteen times the size of Ultima III and puzzle-filled dungeon rooms to explore. Ultima IV further improves the franchise with dialog improvements, new means of travel and exploration, and world interactivity.</p>\n<p>In 1996 Computer Gaming World named Ultima IV as #2 on its Best Games of All Time list on the PC. Designer Richard Garriott considers this game to be among his favorites from the Ultima series.</p>", "added": 993, "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/773/7730495e8fc0fe7e1e747cb9449399ac.jpeg", "genres": ["Adventure", "RPG"], "platforms": ["PC", "macOS", "iOS", "Atari ST", "SEGA Master System", "Classic Macintosh", "Apple II", "Atari 8-bit", "Commodore / Amiga", "NES"], "developers": ["Elite Systems Ltd", "Origin Systems"], "publishers": ["Electronic Arts", "Elite Systems Ltd", "SEGA", "Origin Systems", "Pony Canyon", "Fujisankei Communications International"], "released": "1985-09-16", "EntryPath": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Ultima-Iv-Quest-Of-The-Avatar", "Entry_py": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Ultima-Iv-Quest-Of-The-Avatar/info.py", "Entry_json": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Ultima-Iv-Quest-Of-The-Avatar/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Ultima-Iv-Quest-Of-The-Avatar/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-05-2020"}
