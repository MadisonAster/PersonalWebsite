 'description': '<p>Doki Doki Literature Club puts you into the role of an '
                'anime character, an average Japanese schoolboy. Your '
                'protagonist joins a literature club in which he&#39;s the '
                'only male member. The remaining four girls – Monica, Sayori, '
                'Natsuki, and Yuri – compete for the boy’s attention. Each '
                'girl represents a certain anime character stereotype, such as '
                'tsundere, genki or kudere. As you get to know them closer, '
                'however, they turn out to have individual character traits on '
                'their own. Eventually, you will choose one of the girls to '
                'romance with and follow her personal storyline. The gameplay '
                'is based on interactions with the other characters and '
                'carefully choosing dialogue options. You will also perform '
                'tasks as a club member. The latter includes '
                '&quot;writing&quot; poetry, although the player actually only '
                'gets to select certain words to fill the blanks.<br />\n'
                'The plot and dialogue are front and center in this game. The '
                'visuals and soundtrack, however, are static and minimalistic: '
                'the music is looped, and characters have a very limited '
                'number of sprites in each scene. There&#39;s no voice acting, '
                'and you only interact with characters through text.</p>',
