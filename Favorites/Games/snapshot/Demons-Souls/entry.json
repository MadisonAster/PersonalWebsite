{"name": "Demon's Souls", "slug": "demons-souls", "EntryURL": "https://rawg.io/games/demons-souls", "description": "<p>Demon\u2019s Souls is an action RPG, the first installment in the Souls series, known mostly because of the Dark Souls trilogy. Demon\u2019s Souls is also set in a grey-colored dark medieval-themed world that is attacked by the demon fog. You take on the role of a knight that entered the fog trying to save the kingdom from demons. He was eventually killed and reborn, and now needs to travel the entire kingdom to gain power and set the world free.</p>\n<p>Your character is fully customizable and can be upgraded with souls you get through battles. Demon\u2019s Souls combat system is quite complicated as you can\u2019t gain experience killing ordinary enemies to defeat the boss later. Here you need to work out unique tactics for every monster type. As a result, the gameplay is quite challenging with frequent deaths.</p>\n<p>However, there\u2019s a way to simplify the game a little. Some of your actions, for example, killing or helping NPCs, affect the gameplay. This parameter is called tendency; when it\u2019s white, the enemies are easier and the rewards are fewer. When it\u2019s black, it produces the opposite effect.</p>", "added": 1473, "background_image": "https://media.rawg.io/media/games/ac3/ac3a89bfbda76082402e42b933c5825a.jpg", "genres": ["Action", "RPG"], "platforms": ["PlayStation 3"], "developers": ["Atlus U.S.A., Inc.", "FromSoftware"], "publishers": ["Atlus"], "released": "2009-02-05", "EntryPath": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Demons-Souls", "Entry_py": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Demons-Souls/info.py", "Entry_json": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Demons-Souls/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "Favorites/Games/snapshot/Demons-Souls/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "08-01-2020"}
