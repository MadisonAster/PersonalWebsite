 'description': '<p>Demon’s Souls is an action RPG, the first installment in '
                'the Souls series, known mostly because of the Dark Souls '
                'trilogy. Demon’s Souls is also set in a grey-colored dark '
                'medieval-themed world that is attacked by the demon fog. You '
                'take on the role of a knight that entered the fog trying to '
                'save the kingdom from demons. He was eventually killed and '
                'reborn, and now needs to travel the entire kingdom to gain '
                'power and set the world free.</p>\n'
                '<p>Your character is fully customizable and can be upgraded '
                'with souls you get through battles. Demon’s Souls combat '
                'system is quite complicated as you can’t gain experience '
                'killing ordinary enemies to defeat the boss later. Here you '
                'need to work out unique tactics for every monster type. As a '
                'result, the gameplay is quite challenging with frequent '
                'deaths.</p>\n'
                '<p>However, there’s a way to simplify the game a little. Some '
                'of your actions, for example, killing or helping NPCs, affect '
                'the gameplay. This parameter is called tendency; when it’s '
                'white, the enemies are easier and the rewards are fewer. When '
                'it’s black, it produces the opposite effect.</p>',
