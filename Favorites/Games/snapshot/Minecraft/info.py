 'description': '<p>One of the most popular games of the 2010s, Minecraft '
                'allows you to rebuild the environment around you. The world '
                'of the game is open, infinitely wide, and procedurally '
                'generated. It is composed of small 3D cubes that represent '
                'specific types of materials or terrain. The gameplay is '
                'centered on mining and building various structures of your '
                'choice. You can also craft items like tools, weapons, and '
                'armor. There&#39;s an option to shift to the first or the '
                'third person view.<br />\n'
                'Minecraft includes multiple modes that dramatically change '
                'the focus of the game. Survival and Adventure modes require '
                'the player to gather resources, hunt for food and fight '
                'monsters to survive. In the Hardcore mode, there’s even '
                'permanent death. Creative mode, by contrast, offers you to '
                'freely explore the world and construct whatever you want with '
                'unlimited resources. There’s also a multiplayer mode that '
                'allows the players to share their worlds and engage in the '
                'traditional MMO activities, such as player-vs-player '
                'combat.<br />\n'
                'Minecraft’s crude visual style, reminiscent of Lego cubes, '
                'became an iconic part of the popular culture. There are many '
                'myths and fan fiction surrounding the game, such as the '
                'legend of Herobrine, a rumored character that officially '
                'doesn’t exist.</p>',
