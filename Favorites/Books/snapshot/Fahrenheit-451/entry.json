His job is to burn books, which are forbidden, being the source of all discord and unhappiness. Even so, Montag is unhappy; there is discord in his marriage. Are books hidden in his house? The Mechanical Hound of the Fire Department, armed with a lethal hypodermic, escorted by helicopters, is ready to track down those dissidents who defy society to preserve and read books.<br /><br />The classic dystopian novel of a post-literate future, Fahrenheit 451 stands alongside Orwell\u2019s 1984 and Huxley\u2019s Brave New World as a prophetic account of Western civilization\u2019s enslavement by the media, drugs and conformity.<br /><br />Bradbury\u2019s powerful and poetic prose combines with uncanny insight into the potential of technology to create a novel which, decades on from first publication, still has the power to dazzle and shock.<br /><br />--back cover", "authors": [{"id": "1630", "name": "Ray Bradbury", "role": null, "image_url": "\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1445955959p5/1630.jpg\n", "small_image_url": "\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1445955959p2/1630.jpg\n", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1630.Ray_Bradbury"}], "published": "2013", "work": "  ", "EntryURL": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17470674-fahrenheit-451", "EntryPath": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Fahrenheit-451", "Entry_py": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Fahrenheit-451/info.py", "Entry_json": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Fahrenheit-451/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Fahrenheit-451/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-05-2020"}
