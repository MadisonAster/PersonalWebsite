 'description': 'How do the experts solve difficult problems in software '
                'development? In this unique and insightful book, leading '
                'computer scientists offer case studies that reveal how they '
                'found unusual, carefully designed solutions to high-profile '
                'projects. You will be able to look over the shoulder of major '
                'coding and design experts to see problems through their '
                'eyes.<br /><br />This is not simply another design patterns '
                'book, or another software engineering treatise on the right '
                'and wrong way to do things. The authors think aloud as they '
                "work through their project's architecture, the tradeoffs made "
                'in its construction, and when it was important to break '
                'rules. <i>Beautiful Code</i> is an opportunity for master '
                'coders to tell their story. All author royalties will be '
                'donated to Amnesty International.',
