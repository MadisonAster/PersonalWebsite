 'description': 'Every kid thinks about running away at one point or another; '
                'few get farther than the end of the block. Young Sam Gribley '
                'gets to the end of the block and keeps going--all the way to '
                'the Catskill Mountains of upstate New York. There he sets up '
                'house in a huge hollowed-out tree, with a falcon and a weasel '
                'for companions and his wits as his tool for survival. In a '
                'spellbinding, touching, funny account, Sam learns to live off '
                'the land, and grows up a little in the process. Blizzards, '
                'hunters, loneliness, and fear all battle to drive Sam back to '
                'city life. But his desire for freedom, independence, and '
                'adventure is stronger. No reader will be immune to the '
                'compulsion to go right out and start whittling fishhooks and '
                'befriending raccoons. <p> Jean Craighead George, author of '
                "more than 80 children's books, including the Newbery "
                'Medal-winning <i>Julie of the Wolves</i>, created another '
                'prizewinner with <i>My Side of the Mountain</i>--a Newbery '
                'Honor Book, an ALA Notable Book, and a Hans Christian '
                'Andersen Award Honor Book. Astonishingly, she wrote its '
                'sequel, <i>On the Far Side of the Mountain</i>, 30 years '
                'later, and a decade after that penned the final book in the '
                "trilogy, <i>Frightful's Mountain</i>, told from the falcon's "
                'point of view. George has no doubt shaped generations of '
                'young readers with her outdoor adventures of the mind and '
                'spirit. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>',
