                "/>Meet Ignatius J. Reilly, the hero of John Kennedy Toole's "
                'tragicomic tale, <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i>. This '
                '30-year-old medievalist lives at home with his mother in New '
                'Orleans, pens his magnum opus on Big Chief writing pads he '
                'keeps hidden under his bed, and relays to anyone who will '
                'listen the traumatic experience he once had on a Greyhound '
                'Scenicruiser bound for Baton Rouge. ("Speeding along in that '
                'bus was like hurtling into the abyss.") But Ignatius\'s quiet '
                'life of tyrannizing his mother and writing his endless '
                'comparative history screeches to a halt when he is almost '
                'arrested by the overeager Patrolman Mancuso--who mistakes him '
                'for a vagrant--and then involved in a car accident with his '
                'tipsy mother behind the wheel. One thing leads to another, '
                'and before he knows it, Ignatius is out pounding the pavement '
                'in search of a job.<br /><br />Over the next several hundred '
                'pages, our hero stumbles from one adventure to the next. His '
                'stint as a hotdog vendor is less than successful, and he soon '
                'turns his employers at the Levy Pants Company on their heads. '
                "Ignatius's path through the working world is populated by "
                'marvelous secondary characters: the stripper Darlene and her '
                'talented cockatoo; the septuagenarian secretary Miss Trixie, '
                'whose desperate attempts to retire are constantly, comically '
                'thwarted; gay blade Dorian Greene; sinister Miss Lee, '
                'proprietor of the Night of Joy nightclub; and Myrna Minkoff, '
                'the girl Ignatius loves to hate. The many subplots that weave '
                'through <i>A Confederacy of Dunces</i> are as complicated as '
                "anything you'll find in a Dickens novel, and just as "
                'beautifully tied together in the end. But it is '
                'Ignatius--selfish, domineering, and deluded, tragic and comic '
                'and larger than life--who carries the story. He is a '
                'modern-day Quixote beset by giants of the modern age. His '
                'fragility cracks the shell of comic bluster, revealing a deep '
                'streak of melancholy beneath the antic humor. John Kennedy '
                'Toole committed suicide in 1969 and never saw the publication '
                'of his novel. Ignatius Reilly is what he left behind, a '
                'fitting memorial to a talented and tormented life.',
