                'Ring have become involved in separate adventures as the quest '
                'continues. Aragorn, revealed as the hidden heir of the '
                'ancient Kings of the West, joined with the Riders of Rohan '
                'against the forces of Isengard, and took part in the '
                'desperate victory of the Hornburg. Merry and Pippin, captured '
                'by Orcs, escaped into Fangorn Forest and there encountered '
                'the Ents. Gandalf returned, miraculously, and defeated the '
                'evil wizard, Saruman. Meanwhile, Sam and Frodo progressed '
                'towards Mordor to destroy the Ring, accompanied by '
                "SmEagol--Gollum, still obsessed by his 'precious'. After a "
                'battle with the giant spider, Shelob, Sam left his master for '
                'dead; but Frodo is still alive--in the hands of the Orcs. And '
                'all the time the armies of the Dark Lord are massing. J.R.R. '
                "Tolkien's great work of imaginative fiction has been labeled "
                'both a heroic romance and a classic fantasy fiction. By turns '
                'comic and homely, epic and diabolic, the narrative moves '
                'through countless changes of scene and character in an '
                'imaginary world which is totally convincing in its detail.',
