 'description': '<i>Alternate cover edition of ISBN 0553213695 / '
                '9780553213690</i><br /><br />"As Gregor Samsa awoke one '
                'morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in '
                'his bed into a gigantic insect. He was laying on his hard, as '
                'it were armor-plated, back and when he lifted his head a '
                'little he could see his domelike brown belly divided into '
                'stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could '
                'hardly keep in position and was about to slide off '
                'completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin '
                'compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his '
                'eyes." <br /><br />With it\'s startling, bizarre, yet '
                'surprisingly funny first opening, Kafka begins his '
                'masterpiece, <i>The Metamorphosis</i>. It is the story of a '
                'young man who, transformed overnight into a giant beetle-like '
                'insect, becomes an object of disgrace to his family, an '
                'outsider in his own home, a quintessentially alienated man. A '
                'harrowing—though absurdly comic—meditation on human feelings '
                'of inadequacy, guilt, and isolation, <i>The Metamorphosis</i> '
                'has taken its place as one of the most widely read and '
                'influential works of twentieth-century fiction. As W.H. Auden '
                'wrote, "Kafka is important to us because his predicament is '
                'the predicament of modern man."',
