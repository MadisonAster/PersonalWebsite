Eventually they find work on a ranch in California\u2019s Salinas Valley, but their hopes are doomed as Lennie, struggling against extreme cruelty, misunderstanding and feelings of jealousy, becomes a victim of his own strength. <br /><br />Tackling universal themes such as the friendship of a shared vision, and giving voice to America\u2019s lonely and dispossessed, <i>Of Mice and Men</i> has proved one of Steinbeck\u2019s most popular works, achieving success as a novel, a Broadway play and three acclaimed films.", "authors": [{"id": "585", "name": "John Steinbeck", "role": null, "image_url": "\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1182118389p5/585.jpg\n", "small_image_url": "\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1182118389p2/585.jpg\n", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/585.John_Steinbeck"}], "published": "2002", "work": "  ", "EntryURL": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/890.Of_Mice_and_Men", "EntryPath": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Of-Mice-And-Men", "Entry_py": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Of-Mice-And-Men/info.py", "Entry_json": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Of-Mice-And-Men/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Of-Mice-And-Men/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-05-2020"}
