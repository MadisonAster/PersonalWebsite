                '/>Cryptonomicon zooms all over the world, careening '
                'conspiratorially back and forth between two time '
                'periods--World War II and the present. Our 1940s heroes are '
                'the brilliant mathematician Lawrence Waterhouse, crypt '
                'analyst extraordinaire, and gung-ho, morphine-addicted marine '
                "Bobby Shaftoe. They're part of Detachment 2702, an Allied "
                'group trying to break Axis communication codes while '
                'simultaneously preventing the enemy from figuring out that '
                'their codes have been broken. Their job boils down to layer '
                'upon layer of deception. Dr. Alan Turing is also a member of '
                "2702, and he explains the unit's strange workings to "
                'Waterhouse. "When we want to sink a convoy, we send out an '
                'observation plane first... Of course, to observe is not its '
                'real duty--we already know exactly where the convoy is. Its '
                'real duty is to be observed... Then, when we come round and '
                'sink them, the Germans will not find it suspicious."<br /><br '
                '/>All of this secrecy resonates in the present-day story '
                'line, in which the grandchildren of the WWII '
                'heroes--inimitable programming geek Randy Waterhouse and the '
                'lovely and powerful Amy Shaftoe--team up to help create an '
                'offshore data haven in Southeast Asia and maybe uncover some '
                'gold once destined for Nazi coffers. To top off the paranoiac '
                'tone of the book, the mysterious Enoch Root, key member of '
                'Detachment 2702 and the Societas Eruditorum, pops up with an '
                'unbreakable encryption scheme left over from WWII to befuddle '
                'the 1990s protagonists with conspiratorial ties.',
