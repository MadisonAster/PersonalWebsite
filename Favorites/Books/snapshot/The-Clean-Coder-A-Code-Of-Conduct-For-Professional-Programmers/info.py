 'description': 'Programmers who endure and succeed amidst swirling '
                'uncertainty and nonstop pressure share a common attribute: '
                'They care deeply about the practice of creating software. '
                'They treat it as a craft. They are professionals. In <i> '
                '<b>The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional '
                'Programmers, </b> </i> legendary software expert Robert C. '
                'Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and '
                'practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed '
                'with practical advice-about everything from estimating and '
                'coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than '
                'technique: It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach '
                'software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; '
                'work well and work clean; communicate and estimate '
                'faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and '
                'honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a '
                'responsibility to act. Readers will learn What it means to '
                'behave as a true software craftsman<br />How to deal with '
                'conflict, tight schedules, and unreasonable managers<br />How '
                "to get into the flow of coding, and get past writer's "
                'block<br />How to handle unrelenting pressure and avoid '
                'burnout<br />How to combine enduring attitudes with new '
                'development paradigms<br />How to manage your time, and avoid '
                'blind alleys, marshes, bogs, and swamps<br />How to foster '
                'environments where programmers and teams can thrive<br />When '
                'to say "No"-and how to say it<br />When to say "Yes"-and what '
                'yes really means Great software is something to marvel at: '
                'powerful, elegant, functional, a pleasure to work with as '
                "both a developer and as a user. Great software isn't written "
                'by machines. It is written by professionals with an '
                'unshakable commitment to craftsmanship. <b> <i>The Clean '
                'Coder</i> </b> will help you become one of them-and earn the '
                'pride and fulfillment that they alone possess.',
