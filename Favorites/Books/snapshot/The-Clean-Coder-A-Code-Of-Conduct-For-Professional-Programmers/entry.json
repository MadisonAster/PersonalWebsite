They treat it as a craft. They are professionals. In <i> <b>The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers, </b> </i> legendary software expert Robert C. Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical advice-about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act. Readers will learn What it means to behave as a true software craftsman<br />How to deal with conflict, tight schedules, and unreasonable managers<br />How to get into the flow of coding, and get past writer's block<br />How to handle unrelenting pressure and avoid burnout<br />How to combine enduring attitudes with new development paradigms<br />How to manage your time, and avoid blind alleys, marshes, bogs, and swamps<br />How to foster environments where programmers and teams can thrive<br />When to say \"No\"-and how to say it<br />When to say \"Yes\"-and what yes really means Great software is something to marvel at: powerful, elegant, functional, a pleasure to work with as both a developer and as a user. Great software isn't written by machines. It is written by professionals with an unshakable commitment to craftsmanship. <b> <i>The Clean Coder</i> </b> will help you become one of them-and earn the pride and fulfillment that they alone possess.", "authors": [{"id": "45372", "name": "Robert C.
