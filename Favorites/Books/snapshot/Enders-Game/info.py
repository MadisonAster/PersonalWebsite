 'description': 'Andrew "Ender" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated '
                'war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more '
                'desperate. The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may '
                'be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war '
                'against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The '
                'only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher '
                'training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or '
                'destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it '
                'begins. He will grow up fast.<br /><br />But Ender is not the '
                'only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has '
                'been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the '
                "perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two "
                'older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual '
                'as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too '
                'uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the '
                'capability for violence altogether. Neither was found '
                "suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by "
                'their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. '
                'Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a '
                "ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle "
                'control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through '
                'powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and '
                'identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, '
                'these two begin working together to shape the destiny of '
                'Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother '
                'Ender fails.<br /><br />Source: hatrack.com',
