Everything Corgan is, everything he has ever seen or done, was to prepare him for one moment: a bloodless, computer-controlled virtual war.When Corgan meets his two fellow warriors, he begins to question the Federation. Now Corgan must decide where his loyalties lie, what he's willing to fight for, and exactly what he wants in return. His decisions will affect not only these three virtual warriors, but all the people left on earth.", "authors": [{"id": "50188", "name": "Gloria Skurzynski", "role": null, "image_url": "\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1313418981p5/50188.jpg\n", "small_image_url": "\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1313418981p2/50188.jpg\n", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/50188.Gloria_Skurzynski"}], "published": "2003", "work": "  ", "EntryURL": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/87427.Virtual_War", "EntryPath": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Virtual-War", "Entry_py": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Virtual-War/info.py", "Entry_json": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Virtual-War/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Virtual-War/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-05-2020"}
