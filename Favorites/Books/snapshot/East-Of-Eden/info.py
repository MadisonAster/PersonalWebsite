 'description': 'In his journal, Nobel Prize winner John Steinbeck called East '
                'of Eden “the first book,” and indeed it has the primordial '
                'power and simplicity of myth. Set in the rich farmland of '
                'California’s Salinas Valley, this sprawling and often brutal '
                'novel follows the intertwined destinies of two families—the '
                'Trasks and the Hamiltons—whose generations helplessly reenact '
                'the fall of Adam and Eve and the poisonous rivalry of Cain '
                'and Abel.<br /><br />Adam Trask came to California from the '
                'East to farm and raise his family on the new rich land. But '
                'the birth of his twins, Cal and Aaron, brings his wife to the '
                'brink of madness, and Adam is left alone to raise his boys to '
                'manhood. One boy thrives nurtured by the love of all those '
                'around him; the other grows up in loneliness enveloped by a '
                'mysterious darkness.<br /><br />First published in 1952, East '
                'of Eden is the work in which Steinbeck created his most '
                'mesmerizing characters and explored his most enduring themes: '
                'the mystery of identity, the inexplicability of love, and the '
                "murderous consequences of love's absence. A masterpiece of "
                "Steinbeck's later years, East of Eden is a powerful and "
                'vastly ambitious novel that is at once a family saga and a '
                'modern retelling of the Book of Genesis.<br /><br />--jacket '
