But now the work is piling up on his desk. His people can\u2019t seem to make decisions\u2014certainly not the right ones. His mentor has been fired. Worst of all, his boss sends him out for leadership training. Larry never thought he needed all that \u201cpeople skills\u201d stuff to perform, and spouting buzzwords doesn\u2019t seem to work for him, anyway. I\u2019m doing my job, Larry thinks. What does this company want from me? He truly feels lost.<br /><br />After alienating his staff even more and incurring costly time delays, Larry is sent on a forced vacation, which begins with a comic but poignant fishing trip misadventure. Finally, miles from home and work, Larry opens his mind to new ways of thinking about leadership. He learns important leadership lessons in his daily life: planning a family trip, watching his son play ball, fishing with his daughter. He realizes that everyone needs to KNOW, GROW, and OWN, and that being a leader means helping and enabling people to fulfill those needs. <br /><br />At last Larry has a credo that he can believe in, three powerful principles that all managers can use to get the best from themselves and the people around them.<br /><br />Praised by executives and business experts, <b>Lost &amp; Found </b>reveals the core of leadership through the power of an engaging and wonderfully told story. Managers will recognize parts of themselves and people they know in Larry Parks, a smart worker temporarily stymied by a new type of challenge. At the end of the book the authors provide tips for putting the KNOW-GROW-OWN credo to work in different types of jobs and in different kinds of companies and organizations. Combining inspiration and practical advice, <b>Lost &amp; Found</b> will help talented workers transform themselves into great leaders.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>", "authors": [{"id": "247840", "name": "Lyle Sussman", "role": null, "image_url": "\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_200x266-e183445fd1a1b5cc7075bb1cf7043306.png\n", "small_image_url": "\nhttps://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_50x66-632230dc9882b4352d753eedf9396530.png\n", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/247840.Lyle_Sussman"}], "published": "2004", "work": "  ", "EntryURL": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1282247.Lost_and_Found", "EntryPath": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Lost-And-Found-The-Story-Of-How-One-Man-Discovered-The-Secrets-Of-Leadership---Where-He-Wasnt-Even-Looking", "Entry_py": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Lost-And-Found-The-Story-Of-How-One-Man-Discovered-The-Secrets-Of-Leadership---Where-He-Wasnt-Even-Looking/info.py", "Entry_json": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Lost-And-Found-The-Story-Of-How-One-Man-Discovered-The-Secrets-Of-Leadership---Where-He-Wasnt-Even-Looking/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Lost-And-Found-The-Story-Of-How-One-Man-Discovered-The-Secrets-Of-Leadership---Where-He-Wasnt-Even-Looking/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-05-2020"}
