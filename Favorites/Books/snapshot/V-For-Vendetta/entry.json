Crafted with sterling clarity and intelligence, <i>V for Vendetta</i> brings an unequaled depth of characterization and verisimilitude to its unflinching account of oppression and resistance.", "authors": [{"id": "3961", "name": "Alan Moore", "role": null, "image_url": "\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1304944713p5/3961.jpg\n", "small_image_url": "\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1304944713p2/3961.jpg\n", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3961.Alan_Moore"}], "published": "2005", "work": "  ", "EntryURL": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5805.V_for_Vendetta", "EntryPath": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/V-For-Vendetta", "Entry_py": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/V-For-Vendetta/info.py", "Entry_json": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/V-For-Vendetta/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/V-For-Vendetta/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-05-2020"}
