 'description': '<i>At first, Ender believed that they would bring him back to '
                'Earth as soon as things quieted down. But things were quiet '
                'now, had been quiet for a year, and it was plain to him now '
                'that they would not bring him back at all, that he was much '
                'more useful as a name and a story than he would ever be as an '
                'inconvenient flesh-and-blood person.</i><br /><br />At the '
                "close of <i>Ender's Game</i>, Andrew Wiggin--called Ender by "
                'everyone--knows that he cannot live on Earth. He has become '
                'far more than just a boy who won a game: He is the Savior of '
                'Earth, a hero, a military genius whose allegiance is sought '
                'by every nation of the newly shattered Earth Hegemony.<br '
                '/><br />He is offered the choice of living under the '
                "Hegemon's control, a pawn in his brother Peter's political "
                'games. Or he can join the colony ships and go out to settle '
                'one of the new worlds won in the war.<br /><br />The story of '
                'those years on the colony worlds has never been told...until '
                'now.<br /><br /><i>The voyage was long. By the end of it, Val '
                'had finished the first volume of her history of the bugger '
                "wars and transmitted it by ansible, under Demosthenes' name, "
                'back to Earth, and Ender had won something better than the '
                'adulation of the passengers. They knew him now, and he had '
                'won their love and their respect.</i><br /><br />Ender was '
                'twelve when he chose to leave his home world and begin the '
                'long relativistic journey out to the colonies. With him went '
                'his sister, Valentine, and the core of the artificial '
                'intelligence that would become Jane. He wrote The Hive Queen '
                'and The Hegemon, and his sister wrote The Speaker for the '
                'Dead.<br /><br />He served as governor of his first colony '
                'world, but now Ender is on the move, looking for a planet '
                'where the hive queens might be reestablished.<br /><br />What '
                'he finds in the Ganges colony is more than he bargained '
                'for--a resentful governor who caused a devastating war on '
                'Earth and a brilliant young colonist who is out to destroy '
                'him, starting with his reputation and ending, perhaps, with '
                'his life.',
