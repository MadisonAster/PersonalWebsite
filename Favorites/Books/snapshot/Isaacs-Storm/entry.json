Even Isaac Cline, resident meteorologist for the U.S. Weather Bureau failed to grasp the true meaning of the strange deep-sea swells and peculiar winds that greeted the city that morning. Mere hours later, Galveston found itself submerged in a monster hurricane that completely destroyed the town and killed over six thousand people in what remains the greatest natural disaster in American history--and Isaac Cline found himself the victim of a devastating personal tragedy.<br /><br />Using Cline's own telegrams, letters, and reports, the testimony of scores of survivors, and our latest understanding of the science of hurricanes, Erik Larson builds a chronicle of one man's heroic struggle and fatal miscalculation in the face of a storm of unimaginable magnitude. Riveting, powerful, and unbearably suspenseful, <b>Isaac's Storm</b> is the story of what can happen when human arrogance meets the great uncontrollable force of nature.", "authors": [{"id": "5869", "name": "Erik Larson", "role": null, "image_url": "\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1304371037p5/5869.jpg\n", "small_image_url": "\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1304371037p2/5869.jpg\n", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5869.Erik_Larson"}], "published": null, "work": "  ", "EntryURL": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7225705-isaac-s-storm", "EntryPath": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Isaacs-Storm", "Entry_py": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Isaacs-Storm/info.py", "Entry_json": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Isaacs-Storm/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/Isaacs-Storm/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-24-2020"}
