 'description': 'The Fellowship was scattered. Some were bracing hopelessly '
                'for war against the ancient evil of Sauron. Some were '
                'contending with the treachery of the wizard Saruman. Only '
                'Frodo and Sam were left to take the accursed Ring of Power to '
                'be destroyed in Mordorâ€“the dark Kingdom where Sauron was '
                'supreme. Their guide was Gollum, deceitful and lust-filled, '
                'slave to the corruption of the Ring. Thus continues the '
                'magnificent, bestselling tale of adventure begun in The '
                'Fellowship of the Ring, which reaches its soul-stirring '
                'climax in The Return of the King.',
