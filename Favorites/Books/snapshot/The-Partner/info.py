 'description': 'They watched Danilo Silva for days before they finally '
                'grabbed him. He was living alone, a quiet life on a shady '
                'street in Brazil; a simple life in a modest home, certainly '
                'not one of luxury. Certainly no evidence of the fortune they '
                'thought he had stolen. He was much thinner and his face had '
                'been altered. He spoke a different language, and spoke it '
                'very well.<br /><br />But Danilo had a past with many '
                'chapters. Four years earlier he had been Patrick Lanigan, a '
                'young partner in a prominent Biloxi law firm. He had a pretty '
                'wife, a new daughter, and a bright future. Then one cold '
                'winter night Patrick was trapped in a burning car and died a '
                'horrible death. When he was buried his casket held nothing '
                'more than his ashes.<br /><br />From a short distance away, '
                'Patrick watched his own burial. Then he fled. Six weeks '
                "later, a fortune was stolen from his ex-law firm's offshore "
                'account. And Patrick fled some more.<br /><br />But they '
                'found him.',
