He was living alone, a quiet life on a shady street in Brazil; a simple life in a modest home, certainly not one of luxury. Certainly no evidence of the fortune they thought he had stolen. He was much thinner and his face had been altered. He spoke a different language, and spoke it very well.<br /><br />But Danilo had a past with many chapters. Four years earlier he had been Patrick Lanigan, a young partner in a prominent Biloxi law firm. He had a pretty wife, a new daughter, and a bright future. Then one cold winter night Patrick was trapped in a burning car and died a horrible death. When he was buried his casket held nothing more than his ashes.<br /><br />From a short distance away, Patrick watched his own burial. Then he fled. Six weeks later, a fortune was stolen from his ex-law firm's offshore account. And Patrick fled some more.<br /><br />But they found him.", "authors": [{"id": "721", "name": "John Grisham", "role": null, "image_url": "\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1583932591p5/721.jpg\n", "small_image_url": "\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1583932591p2/721.jpg\n", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/721.John_Grisham"}], "published": "2005", "work": "  ", "EntryURL": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5350.The_Partner", "EntryPath": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/The-Partner", "Entry_py": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/The-Partner/info.py", "Entry_json": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/The-Partner/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/The-Partner/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-05-2020"}
