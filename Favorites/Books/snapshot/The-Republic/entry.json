During the conversation, other questions are raised: what is goodness?; what is reality?; and what is knowledge? The Republic also addresses the purpose of education and the role of both women and men as guardians of the people. With remarkable lucidity and deft use of allegory, Plato arrives at a depiction of a state bound by harmony and ruled by philosopher kings.", "authors": [{"id": "879", "name": "Plato", "role": null, "image_url": "\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1393978633p5/879.jpg\n", "small_image_url": "\nhttps://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1393978633p2/879.jpg\n", "link": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/879.Plato"}], "published": "2003", "work": "  ", "EntryURL": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30289.The_Republic", "EntryPath": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/The-Republic", "Entry_py": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/The-Republic/info.py", "Entry_json": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/The-Republic/entry.json", "Entry_thumb": "Favorites/Books/snapshot/The-Republic/thumb.jpg", "EntryAdded": "06-05-2020"}
