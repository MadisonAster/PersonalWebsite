 'description': '<b>Ken Follett is known worldwide as the master of '
                'split-second suspense, but his most beloved and bestselling '
                'book tells the magnificent tale of a twelfth-century monk '
                'driven to do the seemingly impossible: build the greatest '
                'Gothic cathedral the world has ever known.</b><br /><br '
                '/>Everything readers expect from Follett is here: intrigue, '
                'fast-paced action, and passionate romance. But what makes '
                '<i>The Pillars of the Earth</i> extraordinary is the time the '
                'twelfth century; the place feudal England; and the subject '
                'the building of a glorious cathedral. Follett has re-created '
                'the crude, flamboyant England of the Middle Ages in every '
                'detail. The vast forests, the walled towns, the castles, and '
                'the monasteries become a familiar landscape. <br /><br '
                '/>Against this richly imagined and intricately interwoven '
                'backdrop, filled with the ravages of war and the rhythms of '
                'daily life, the master storyteller draws the reader '
                'irresistibly into the intertwined lives of his characters '
                'into their dreams, their labors, and their loves: Tom, the '
                'master builder; Aliena, the ravishingly beautiful noblewoman; '
                'Philip, the prior of Kingsbridge; Jack, the artist in stone; '
                'and Ellen, the woman of the forest who casts a terrifying '
                'curse. From humble stonemason to imperious monarch, each '
                'character is brought vividly to life.<br /><br />The building '
                'of the cathedral, with the almost eerie artistry of the '
                'unschooled stonemasons, is the center of the drama. Around '
                'the site of the construction, Follett weaves a story of '
                'betrayal, revenge, and love, which begins with the public '
                'hanging of an innocent man and ends with the humiliation of a '
                'king.<br /><br /><i>For the Movie tie-in edition with the '
