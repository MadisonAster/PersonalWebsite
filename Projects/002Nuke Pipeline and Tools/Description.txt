In my work at Lit Post I quickly transitioned from operating as the sole vfx artist on staff, to debugging, troubleshooting, and managing all of our software solutions. For the first year of my work there, the rener farm, IT operations, cabling, and scripting were all covered by myself and my dear friend Gustavo.
As we grew, and moved to Burbank, the number of Nuke compositing tools that we needed also grew. At our height I wrote and maintained scripts for around 10 artists.
One of the best refinements I made to our pipeline was what I called a binary bundling system. This takes the entire set of nuke scripts as they currently exists, compiles them into binary code using pythons runtime compiler, and stuffs them into the metadata of the nuke project file. The binary files are then loaded on the fly. 
This has a number of distinct advantages, outsourced houses can use binary versions of our proprietary tools, clients can be given a working nuke script for archiving on delivery requiring only the appropriate version of nuke to run, and the artists could continue to work even while our network was down.
It was while working with Nuke on such a consistent basis that I started working with PySide so regularly, and learned a lot about the Qt Library in the process. This knowledge has proved quite valuable.
