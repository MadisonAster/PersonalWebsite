
My 2020 new-years resolution was to declutter my living room and get rid of some old furniture. I designed a set of bookshelves for an alcove that would serve the dual purpose of being both an entertainment center, and a miniature walk-in library. My apartment is from the 1920's, so it has a lot of strange features like this alcove, and I wanted to take advantage of 100% of the space. I very carefully measured and designed everything in CAD, cut, sanded, painted, and assembled it. The trickiest part was definitely hiding all of the brackets to give it the appearance that it's floating. Vertical Cable runs are in the back corners that run the entire length of the unit. 
To give it a hidden feature I added a coat of UV reactive paint to the front edges, and an old black light. Party Mode ^-^! The renovations took me about 2 months to complete. Fortunately I completed it just a couple weeks before Los Angeles went into lockdown. For some odd reason I've been 2 steps ahead of every disaster this year, and it's been both a blessing and a curse. Wearing a mask during February earned me some strange looks, but I was just trying to do what was necessary to stop the pandemic and prepare for the lockdown. I won't appologize for it. What's strange to me is that everyone else didn't do the same.
