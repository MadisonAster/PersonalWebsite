
My 2020 new-years resolution was to clean up my living room. I designed a set of bookshelves to build into this alcove in my living room. My apartment is from the 1920's, so it has a lot of strange features. I very carefully measured and designed everything in CAD, cut, sanded, painted, and put everything together. The trickiest part was definitely hiding all of the brackets to give it the appearance that it's floating. Vertical Cable runs run the entire length of the back 2 corners. And To give it something extra I added a coat of UV reactive paint to the front edges, and added an old black light. Party Mode ^-^! The renovations took me about 2 months to complete. Fortunately I had it done just a couple weeks before Los Angeles went into lockdown.
