The largest effort I've undertaken in 2016 has been working on a unified VR project in Unreal Engine, capable of running across all platforms, and including the use of a variety of expiramental devices such as the LEAP motion, and Virtuix Omni. Anyone working on their own VR projects can tell you that working with any 1 VR device is a breeze. However making it work across several platforms is like pulling teeth. Oculus for instance measures its head position from the camera level, while Vive works from the floor. Button mappings, tracking acuracy, and feel all change between platforms. So the goal has been handling it all in blueprints at runtime.
The project itself is a virtual travel application. Just a bunch of super high poly maps mostly from photogrammetry. So fortunately for this 1 man programming team it means there isn't much gameplay to program, although I still found myself doing a some of the modeling, and all the colisions myself.
I got it all working quite well, and we even showed it off at our own booth for VRLA 2016, but since then our development budget dried up and I've just been maintaining and updating it to the latest version of Unreal since then.
