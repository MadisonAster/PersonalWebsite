
At Saatchi & Saatchi I was initially building VR applications for brands like Asics shoes, and Toyota. Soon though, my sole focus became automating the processing of Toyota's engineering data for the purpose of rendering it in 3D. Studying their manufacturing data has been one of the most exciting things I've done to date. To organize their complex network of data structures I recycled a pattern from my Mistika API, a recursive class generator. This allowed me to organize all of the various data trees without repeating logic for each new form that their data would take. I then built a framework into the Deadline render farm in their VFX department to serve as a microservices backplane, which I then built a plugins on top of. The services I built for it included tessellating nurbs data with Unreal, organizing the various bits of encrypted spreadsheet data from Excel, providing uvs and materials, and creating an assembled vehicle structure in Maya and Unreal.
