            <br/>
            Hi I'm Maddie ^-^!
            <br/><br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;I'm a software engineer from Hollywood California. I've programmed this website to showcase my full stack development skills, my engineering projects, my work history, and some of my artwork. The pages in this portfolio are mostly generated by scripts that collect data from various public accounts. These data connections allow the website to update itself and save me the trouble of maintaining it directly.
            <br/><br/>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;The entire source for this site is available on GitHub, and I encourage you to take the time to explore it to see how the components work.  I hope that this website gives you a chance to peer inside my head.  Don't get lost in the basement ^-^!

            You'll find my skills table below, listed chronoligically, with my estimated proficiency.

            <h2 style='text-align:left;'>What I'm looking for:</h2>
            <br/>
            My project ideas have outgrown my own work capacity. In the next five years I want to focus on building a team of engineers that can work synchronously together to execute bigger projects in a shorter period of time.
            I'm a firm believer in Test Driven Development, and the benefits of Pair Programming.  I think developers work best when they learn to compliment each other, and I'd like to design a series of multi participant Kata to improve team cohesion.
            It's important to practice your kung fu.
            <br/><br/>
            I'm interested in finding a company that I can build an Unreal plugin for to completely automate the film pre-production process, from script to sequence.  
            There is an extraordinary amount of data that I'm afraid is being wasted by the pre-production process not being directly connected to post. 
            <br/><br/>
            I'm also extremely interested in procedurally generated game designs. I've built some classes in unreal to procedurally generate sublevels in various patterns, and I would like to extend that further now that we have RTX.
            <br/><br/>
            Photogrammetry pipelines are another interest of mine. I've built some robotic control software for a scanner, and I would like to completely industrialize that process
            <br/><br/>
            VR Games are still dear to my heart, however the industry has been slow to take off. I think this is primarily due to the lack of a killer app. I think the game I really need to build for this would include a combination of experimental hardware and tracking.
            I have a solution for the constrained locomotion problem involving rotating doors. And I believe another level of imersion can be achieved by integrating a leap motion style hand tracking system, and a device called the Subpack to trick the player's brain into feeling like they are speaking as the protagonist.
            <br/><br/>
            I also have a method for displaying deep compositing data in Javascript that I think could offer far more fidelity at a far lower performance cost than 3D rendering via webGL. I would like to develop that further. I think it could revolutionize the way that images are displayed on the web.
            <br/><br/>
            <h2 style='text-align:left;'>The Long Story:</h2>
            <br/>
            I've made it my goal in life to shorten my learning curve for aquiring new skills. I believe that adaptability is a skill unto itself, and that it's something that should be practiced.
            <br/><br/>
            In gradeschool I took some classes on broadcasting, production, video editing, and compositing. This led to me experimenting with 3D modeling and game engines. 
            <br/><br/>
            In high school I continued to take my skills further. Every school assignment I did inevitably became an over the top design project that required me to work long unnecessary hours to complete.
            It was around this time I also started to really understand programming. Debugging applications in assembly became routine, the tricks I learned in my web design classes kept me busy at night.
            My CCNA and IT courses led me to an internship as an IT administrator, and I also wrote scripts to automate IT work for a non-profit. During this time my first real job was working for a clothing manufacturer writing scripts for industrial embroidery machines.
            <br/><br/>
            In film school I was exposed to a vast variety of new design software. Node based compositors, 3d trackers, particle effects. I worked nights several nights a week as a grip/electrician on the school sound stages.
            <br/><br/>
            I got my start in film at Lit Post, on a low budget project called scavengers. It was a DI facility looking to expand into visual effects, so I was their first hire. 
            Working primarily in Nuke, Flame, and Maya, I worked with our with our only 3D artist to turn out over 600 vfx shots.
            I built the renderfarm myself, also performed conform for that show in Film Master.
            <br/><br/>
            After becoming a Software Developer for Lit Post I built a vfx pipeline for the company connecting Shotgun, Filemaker, Nuke, Maya, and a Color Finishing program called Mistika with pseudo-API I created for it in python.
            <br/><br/>
            At cognition I focused heavily on research into Unreal Engine, built various VR experiments. I tested a lot of different experimental hardware, and I got to build a VR travel platform. I also designed/built booth for an industry tradeshow called VRLA.
            <br/><br/>
            At Saatchi and Saatchi I was initially building VR applications for Asics shoes, and Toyota.
            Soon though, my sole focus became automating the processing of Toyota's engineering data for the purpose of rendering it in 3D.
            Studying their manufacturing data has been one of the most exciting things I've done to date.
            To organize their complex network of data structures I recycled a pattern from my Mistika API, a recursive class generator.
            This allowed me to organize all of the various data trees without repeating logic for each new form that their data would take.
            I then bastardized the Deadline render farm software from their VFX department to act more like kubernetes, which I then built a microservices pipeline on top of.
            The services I built for it included tessellating nurbs data with Unreal, organizing the various bits of encrypted spreadsheet data from Excel, providing uvs and materials, and creating an assembled vehicle structure in Maya and Unreal.
            <br/><br/>

            <h2 style='text-align:left;'>About my coding style:</h2>
            <br/><br/>
            I focus heavily on modularity in my designs. I'm a firm believer in the adage that if the purpose of a function needs more than one sentence to describe, then it should be split into parts. 
            <br/><br/>
            Now this is nearly impossible to follow as a hard rule, because a description can as wide or as granular as you choose to make it. In general, if it starts to exceed the length of my screen though, I re-evaluate it.
            <br/><br/>
            In keeping with this format I usually write most of my comments like this:
            <br/><br/>
            <img src='_Assets/ImgPlaceHolder.png' psrc='_Assets/ImgPlaceHolder.png' rsrc='_Assets/Stills/CodeCommentsExample.png' style='width:100%;'></img>
            <br/><br/>
            I always follow the Takes/Performs/Returns structure, and when I return to the function to use it later I can quickly assess exactly what the function does. I immediately know what kind of data to give it, what kinds of calls it will make, and what kind of data it will return to me.
            <br/><br/>
            Also, though it may be a little picky, I find it much more convenient to place the comment inside the function so that folding editors will minimize the functions properly. When I open a module in my favorite editor (<a target='_blank' href='https://notepad-plus-plus.org/'>Notepad++</a>), I hit Alt-0, and can immediately assess structures from a top level view.
            <br/><br/>
            <img src='_Assets/ImgPlaceHolder.png' psrc='_Assets/ImgPlaceHolder.png' rsrc='_Assets/Stills/CodeFoldingExample.png' style='width:60%;'></img>
            <br/><br/>
            Object Recycling is the greatest optimization of all in my opinion. It may have cost me 10% more to write functions when I was still a beginner, but by sticking with it, I've built a vast library of powerful functions to draw from when building new applications. Often the simplest answer to a problem is so beautiful that I don't even have to look it up, I can re-write the function from memory.

            <h2 style='text-align:left;'>About my decision making process:</h2>
            <br/><br/>
            Like anybody else, I conceive of ideas for projects large and small far too often, and just like anyone else my schedule quickly becomes overrun by these ideas. To solve this dilemma, I've developed filters through which an idea must survive in order to warrant being added to my schedule:
            <br/><br/>
            New Projects:
            <br/>
            <div style='padding-left:24px;'>
            1. Will the resources required to complete the project exceed a responsible budget?
            <br/>
            2. Will the development value that the project produces be useful in other projects?
            <br/>
            3. Are there any resources that I currently have available that put me closer to completing the project faster than the 5 competitors that just thought of the exact same idea?
            </div>
            <br/><br/>
            Project Improvements:
            <br/>
            <div style='padding-left:24px;'>
            1. No project is ever complete, nor is it ever perfect. It can be improved, but each improvement must be measured by it's objective benefits. If any conceived improvement is purely subjective, and no part of it can be explained objectively, then the opportunity cost of making the improvement is greater than its value. 
            </div>
            <br/><br/>
            Process Improvements:
            <br/>
            <div style='padding-left:24px;'>
            1. This equation is <a target='_blank' href='https://xkcd.com/1205/'>much simpler</a>.
