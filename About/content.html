            <h2 style='text-align:left;'>About Me:</h2>
            <br/>
            Hi I'm Maddie ^-^!
            <br/><br/>
            I'm a software engineer from Hollywood California. I've written this kubernetes application to showcase my full stack development skills, my engineering projects, my work history, and some of my artwork. The pages in this portfolio are mostly generated by scripts that collect data from various public accounts. These data connections allow the app to update itself and save me the trouble of maintaining it directly.
            <br/><br/>
            The source is available on my GitHub, and I encourage you to take the time to explore it to see how the components work.  I hope that this app gives you a chance to peer inside my head.  
            <br/><br/>
            Oh, and don't get lost in the basement ^-^!

            You'll find my skills table below, listed chronoligically, with my estimated proficiencies. This data is part of a larger automated notekeeping pipeline that I use to track and evaluate my own professional progress.
            <br/><br/>
            {xpTable}
            <br/><br/>
            <h2 style='text-align:left;'>What I'm looking for:</h2>
            I've targeted my software development career towards the rapidly approaching convergence of the Visual Effects, Video Game, and Cloud Computing industries. I believe that the convenience of Docker's containerization system will create a tsunami of fully multi-threaded real time graphics applications in the next 10 years.
            <br/><br/>
            With this in mind, my project ideas have outgrown my own work capacity.  In the next five years I want to focus on building a team of engineers that can work synchronously together to execute bigger projects in shorter periods of time.
            I'm a believer in Test Driven Development, and the benefits of Pair Programming.  I think developers work best when they learn to complement each other, and I'd like to design a series of multi-player kata for teams to practice this synchronicity.
            It's important to practice your kung fu.
            <br/><br/>
            <h2 style='text-align:left;'>Here, have some free ideas:</h2>
            I'm interested in finding a company that I can build an Unreal plugin for to completely automate the film pre-production process, from script to sequence.  
            There is an extraordinary amount of data that I'm afraid is being wasted by the pre-production process not being directly connected to post. 
            <br/><br/>
            I'm also extremely interested in procedurally generated game designs. I've built some classes in Unreal to procedurally generate sublevels in various patterns, and I would like to extend that further now that we have RTX.
            <br/><br/>
            Photogrammetry pipelines are another interest of mine. I've built some robotic control software for a scanner, and I would like to completely industrialize that process
            <br/><br/>
            VR Games are still dear to my heart, however the industry has been slow to take off. I think this is primarily due to the lack of a killer app. I think the game I really need to build for this would include a combination of experimental hardware and tracking.
            I have a solution for the constrained locomotion problem involving rotating doors. Further, I believe another level of imersion can be achieved by integrating a leap motion style hand tracking system, and a device called the Subpack to trick the player's brain into feeling like they are speaking as the protagonist.
            <br/><br/>
            I have a method for displaying deep compositing data in Javascript that I think could offer far more fidelity at a far lower performance cost than 3D rendering via WebGL. I would like to develop that further. I think it could revolutionize the way that images are displayed on the web.
            <br/><br/>
            I really think there should be a node based gui for docker/kubernetes because yaml files are structurally simple enough to represent as nodes. If the interface supported features such as an execution pin like Unreal Blueprints or Filter Forge, it would allow for containers to be constructed from more complex scipts. The constant overview you get from the visual nature of node graphs makes it possible to quickly construct and maintain complex programs, and typed data is easily represented with connection colors.
            <br/><br/>
            <h2 style='text-align:left;'>The long story:</h2>
            I've made it my goal in life to shorten my learning curve for aquiring new skills. I believe that adaptability is a skill unto itself, and that it's something that should be practiced.
            <br/><br/>
            In gradeschool I took some classes on broadcasting, production, video editing, and compositing. This led to me experimenting with 3D modeling and game engines. 
            <br/><br/>
            In high school I continued to take my skills further. Every school assignment I did inevitably became an over the top project that required me to work long unnecessary hours to complete.
            It was around this time I also started to really understand programming. Debugging applications in assembly became routine, the tricks I learned in my web design classes kept me busy at night.
            My CCNA and IT courses led me to an internship as an IT administrator, and I also wrote scripts to automate IT work for a non-profit. My first real job was working for a clothing manufacturer writing scripts for industrial embroidery machines.
            <br/><br/>
            In film school I was exposed to a vast variety of new design software. Node based compositors, 3d trackers, particle effects. I worked several nights a week as a grip/electrician on the school sound stages.
            <br/><br/>
            I got my start in film at Lit Post, on a low budget project called Scavengers. It was a DI facility looking to expand into visual effects, so I was their first hire. 
            Working primarily in Nuke, Flame, and Maya, I worked with our with our only 3D artist to turn out over 600 vfx shots.
            I built the renderfarm myself. I also created a multi-layer exr DI conform timeline for that show in Film Master.
            <br/><br/>
            After becoming a Software Developer for Lit Post I built a vfx pipeline for the company connecting Shotgun, Filemaker, Nuke, Maya, and a Color Finishing program called Mistika with a pseudo-API I created for it in python.
            <br/><br/>
            At Cognition I focused heavily on research into Unreal Engine, built various VR experiments. I tested a lot of different experimental hardware, and I got to build a VR travel platform. I also designed/built booth for an industry tradeshow called VRLA.
            <br/><br/>
            At Saatchi & Saatchi I was initially building VR applications for brands like Asics shoes, and Toyota.
            Soon though, my sole focus became automating the processing of Toyota's engineering data for the purpose of rendering it in 3D.
            Studying their manufacturing data has been one of the most exciting things I've done to date.
            To organize their complex network of data structures I recycled a pattern from my Mistika API, a recursive class generator.
            This allowed me to organize all of the various data trees without repeating logic for each new form that their data would take.
            I then built a framework into the Deadline render farm in their VFX department to serve as a microservices backplane, which I then built a plugins on top of.
            The services I built for it included tessellating nurbs data with Unreal, organizing the various bits of encrypted spreadsheet data from Excel, providing uvs and materials, and creating an assembled vehicle structure in Maya and Unreal.
