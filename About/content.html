As if it wasn't apparent enough from the obnoxious url, my name is Thomas McVay. I'm a Software Developer, Artist, and Engineer currently living and working in Hollywood CA. Along with my work in VFX on a variety of films, I've worked on a number of software development projects over the years.

<h2 style='text-align:left;'>My Experience:</h2>
<br/><br/>
In the table below I've listed the various technologies I've encountered during my lifetime. By default they are listed chronologically by the year I first started using them. The table is also sortable by my current proficiency level. Obviously these values are approximate, but I've done my best to keep it as accurate as possible.

    <h2 style='text-align:left;'>The Long Story:</h2>
    As a child I learned to read on windows 95, I spent my youth in irc chatrooms, and struggled with various networking concepts, and figuring out how to clean viruses off of pcs.
    <br/><br/>
    At 12 I got involved with a pretty remarkable media program that the school I was going to at the time had. We did a live television broadcast every morning. Producing amateur videos for that gave me my first taste of professional design applications.
    <br/><br/>
    I started trying out any sort of application I could find, early game engines, and 3d modelling applications were of particular interest to me. I spent days tying up our phone line downloading early versions of blender, lightwave, after effects, and others at 4KB a second.
    <br/><br/>
    In high school I took it a step further. Any time we were assigned a project, I would come up with an unnecessarily over the top design and spend entire weekends working on it with my rudimentary 3D skills.
    <br/><br/>
    It was around this time I also started to really understand programming. Debugging applications in assembly became routine, the tricks I learned in my web design classes kept me busy at night, and I finally moved to an area that had cable internet. I was hungry for speed.
    <br/><br/>
    One of the high schools I went to had a CCNA program, never thought I could learn so much about routing protocols, and for a router programming competition I learned to put the head on a Cat5 cable in 30 seconds flat. The teacher running the CCNA program recommended me for an intern-ship as an IT guy at an elementary school in the district. I learned quickly how boring it was to be an IT guy, removing the same viruses from machine after machine, and the futility of trying to get end users to change their behaviour.
    <br/><br/>
    Also worked on a charity called computers for kids. As the county government would cycle out old machines, we took them, repaired them, and gave them away to children. Created some automated install disks to streamline the process, and disassembled/reassembled hundreds of machines of varying make/model. 
    <br/><br/>
    From there I got my first paying job doing graphic design for a t-shirt shop. Learned Illustrator, and some specialized Embroidery software. How to fix firmware on industrial machines that weren't really meant to be hacked.
    <br/><br/>
    <br/><br/>
    Finally, when it was time to make a decision on college, I decided film would be a great fit for me, because I could spend so many hours working on it without a thought.
    <br/><br/>
    In film school I was exposed to a vast variety of new design software. Node based compositors, 3d trackers, particle effects. With the stages they had available I spent several nights a week as a grip/electrician becoming ever more familiar with the production process.
    <br/><br/>
    <br/><br/>
    After graduating college, and moving back to California, I got my first job as a vfx compositor with a company called Lit Post that was starting a low budget project called scavengers. Lit Post was a DI facility looking to expand by creating a vfx department, and when I got hired, for some time I was that department. Working primarily in Nuke, I was the only full time compositor on a show with a total of around 600 vfx shots. I got my first exposure here to all of the problems inherent in the vfx pipeline, learned a lot about colorspaces from the Owner/Lead Colorist at the company, set up the render farm for the 3d artists, and worked with them to reduce render times on the spaceships and solve the technical problems that arose.
    <br/><br/>
    It was on Scavengers that I learned how much value automation has to the production process. Even with a low budget show like that, we quickly exceeded 15TB of data. Moving that much data around can become messy in a hurry, and god help you if you leave things up to each individual artist to name their files.
    <br/><br/>
    This vacuum of need has pushed me to become an expert in python. Almost every application in the post production industry has a python api, and when we switched over to a new color grading system that didn't have one, I wrote one for it. It is my favorite programming language by far, much of this website, and almost every other project I have worked on is dependent on it, and I can scarcely convey the excitement that I feel as I discover new things that I can do with it every single day.
    <br/><br/>
    I have a lot of work to do still, and way too many ideas that I want to get out of my head, so I hope you'll find the resources I've added to Links section this site as I do, and I hope that we can work together in the future to continue to accelerate the pace of our development.

<h2 style='text-align:left;'>About my decision making process:</h2>
<br/><br/>
Like anybody else, I conceive of ideas for projects large and small far too often, and just like anyone else my schedule quickly becomes overrun by these ideas. To solve this dilemma, I've developed filters through which an idea must survive in order to warrant being added to my schedule:
<br/><br/>
New Projects:
<br/>
<div style='padding-left:24px;'>
1. Will the resources required to complete the project exceed a responsible budget?
<br/>
2. Will the development value that the project produces be useful in other projects?
<br/>
3. Are there any resources that I currently have available that put me closer to completing the project faster than the 5 competitors that just thought of the exact same idea?
</div>
<br/><br/>
Project Improvements:
<br/>
<div style='padding-left:24px;'>
1. No project is ever complete, nor is it ever perfect. It can be improved, but each improvement must be measured by it's objective benefits. If any conceived improvement is purely subjective, and no part of it can be explained objectively, then the opportunity cost of making the improvement is greater than its value. 
</div>
<br/><br/>
Process Improvements:
<br/>
<div style='padding-left:24px;'>
1. This equation is <a target='_blank' href='https://xkcd.com/1205/'>much simpler</a>.

<h2 style='text-align:left;'>About my coding style:</h2>
<br/><br/>
I focus heavily on modularity in my designs. I'm a firm believer in the adage that if the purpose of a function needs more than one sentence to describe, then it should be split into parts. 
<br/><br/>
Now this is nearly impossible to follow as a hard rule, because a description can as wide or as granular as you choose to make it. In general, if it starts to exceed the length of my screen though, I re-evaluate it.
<br/><br/>
In keeping with this format I usually write most of my comments like this:
<br/><br/>
<img src='_Assets/Stills/CodeCommentsExample.png' style='width:100%;'></img>
<br/><br/>
I always follow the Takes/Performs/Returns structure, and when I return to the function to use it later I can quickly assess exactly what the function does. I immediately know what kind of data to give it, what kinds of calls it will make, and what kind of data it will return to me.
<br/><br/>
Also, though it may be a little picky, I find it much more convenient to place the comment inside the function so that folding editors will minimize the functions properly. When I open a module in my favorite editor (<a target='_blank' href='https://notepad-plus-plus.org/'>Notepad++</a>), I hit Alt-0, and can immediately assess structures from a top level view.
<br/><br/>
<img src='_Assets/Stills/CodeFoldingExample.png' style='width:60%;'></img>
<br/><br/>
Object Recycling is the greatest optimization of all in my opinion. It may have cost me 10% more to write functions when I was still a beginner, but by sticking with it, I've built a vast library of powerful functions to draw from when building new applications. Often the simplest answer to a problem is so beautiful that I don't even have to look it up, I can re-write the function from memory.
