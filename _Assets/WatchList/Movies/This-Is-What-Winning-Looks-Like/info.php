 'Description' => '\r\n              This Is What Winning Looks Like: "This Is What Winning Looks Like" is a disturbing new documentary about the ineptitude, drug abuse, sexual misconduct, and corruption of the Afghan security forces as well as the reduced role of US Marines due to the troop withdrawal. In part one, we see just how chaotic and hopeless the situation is in Sangin, one of the most violent towns in Afghanistan.\r\nBen Anderson went to Afghanistan in 2007 to make a film about the vicious fighting between under-equipped British forces and the Taliban in Helmand, the country\'s most violent province. He didn\'t plan on staying for six years. But we\'re glad he did, because now we have This Is What Winning Looks Like, a disturbing new documentary about the ineptitude, drug abuse, sexual misconduct, and corruption of the Afghan government and its security forces as well as the role of US Marines during the troop withdrawal.
