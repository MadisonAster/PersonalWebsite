I've put quite a bit of work into refining this website over time. Years ago this thing was entirely built in Flash. When I replaced the code I started constructing it with the idea that everything should have a modular structure. I didn't want to use Django because I felt it would add more complexity than was necessary, so I opted to write the skeleton of it in php.
I also wanted it to become something that would update on its own, and help chronologe my life with as little work from me as possible. To this end I've added a number of features and python scripts that handle background processes automatically.
Finally there's the background, I wanted something unique, and I wanted the entire site to be stateless. Because I was working one the Cognition.la website at the time I found this website that I liked:
<a target='_blank' href='http://www.emergeinteractive.com/demos/javascript-video-scrubber/
'>http://www.emergeinteractive.com/demos/javascript-video-scrubber/
</a>
So I rebuilt the javascript myself, and rendered a background in nuke for it that looks almost exactly like the one you see now. It worked in most desktop browsers, but even with hyper compressed webp images, and stochastic on the fly loading, the final size still wound up being ~100MB. Bad for slow connections, and bringing all mobile devices to their knees.
A bit wiser these days, I've replaced it with the playcanvas game engine. Which loads in under 5MB, and performs respectably on all platforms.
