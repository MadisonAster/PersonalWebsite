While LitPost was still running its color operations, I did some work for an interesting movie called In A Valley Of Violence. The entire show was shot on film, and we were responsible for doing the telecine on it in house. The problem was that the telecine machine that we had was made for 4 perf film, while this movie was shot on 2 perf film.
Scanning an entirely different set of film was not supported behavior. So in addition to having to write custom scripts for the scanning program itself to trick it into doing what we wanted, I also had to write postprocessing scripts that would break apart each frame into two sections, renumber the frames, then correct the pixel offset for each set of frames. All while preserving the metadata that conform needed of course.
To top everything off, 1 of the reels was shot backward. Requiring a second set of modified scripts to handle just the one reel. Quite the headache, but I guess that's why this is one of the last movies to ever be shot on film.
